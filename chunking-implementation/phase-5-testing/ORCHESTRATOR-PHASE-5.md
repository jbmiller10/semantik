# Phase 5: Testing & Hardening - Orchestrator Guide

**Phase Duration**: 3 days  
**Phase Priority**: HIGH  
**Agent Requirements**: 2 agents working in parallel  
**Can Start**: After all implementation phases complete  

## Phase Overview

Comprehensive testing to verify system resilience and performance at scale before production deployment.

## Critical Context

ðŸš¨ **PRE-RELEASE APPLICATION** - We can be aggressive with testing since there are no production users to impact.

## Parallel Execution

Both test suites can run simultaneously:
- `TICKET-TEST-001.md` - Chaos Engineering Tests (Agent A)
- `TICKET-TEST-002.md` - Load Testing at Scale (Agent B)

## Test Scenarios

### Chaos Engineering
- Kill Redis during operation
- Database failover simulation
- OOM conditions (95% memory)
- Network partitions
- Instance crashes

### Load Testing
- 10,000 concurrent WebSockets
- 100 simultaneous operations
- 1TB total data processed
- 24-hour stability test

## Success Criteria

### Resilience
- [ ] System recovers from all failure modes
- [ ] No data corruption after failures
- [ ] Clear error messages to users
- [ ] Automatic retry with exponential backoff

### Performance
- [ ] P99 latency <1 second
- [ ] Handles target load without degradation
- [ ] Memory stable over 24 hours
- [ ] No memory leaks detected

## Test Infrastructure

```yaml
# docker-compose.test.yml
services:
  locust:
    image: locustio/locust
    command: -f /tests/load_test.py --host http://webui:8000
    volumes:
      - ./tests:/tests
    
  chaos-monkey:
    image: chaos-monkey
    environment:
      - TARGETS=redis,postgres,webui
      - PROBABILITY=0.1
```

## Validation

```bash
# Run chaos tests
python tests/chaos/run_chaos_suite.py

# Run load tests
locust -f tests/load/load_test.py --users 1000 --spawn-rate 10

# 24-hour stability
nohup python tests/stability/long_run.py &
```

## Notes

- Document all failure modes discovered
- Create runbooks for each failure scenario
- Establish performance baselines
- Set up alerting thresholds based on test results
