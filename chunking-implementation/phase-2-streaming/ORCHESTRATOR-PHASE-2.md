# Phase 2: Streaming Implementation - Orchestrator Guide

**Phase Duration**: 5 days  
**Phase Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Agent Requirements**: 2 agents with AsyncIO/streaming expertise  
**Can Start**: After Phase 1 completes  

## Phase Overview

This phase implements streaming to handle unlimited file sizes with bounded memory usage. This is the most complex technical challenge in the project.

## Critical Context

ðŸš¨ **PRE-RELEASE APPLICATION** - Implement streaming from ground up. Don't create streaming + non-streaming versions - just replace everything with streaming.

## Ticket Execution Order

### Sequential Execution Required
1. `TICKET-STREAM-001.md` - Core Streaming Pipeline (3 days) - MUST complete first
2. `TICKET-STREAM-002.md` - Adapt Strategies (2 days) - Depends on STREAM-001

## Critical Technical Requirements

### UTF-8 Boundary Handling (CRITICAL)
```python
# WRONG - Will corrupt multi-byte characters
chunk = buffer[:1024]

# CORRECT - Find safe UTF-8 boundary
def find_utf8_boundary(buffer, max_pos):
    while max_pos > 0:
        # Check if we're at a character boundary
        if (buffer[max_pos] & 0xC0) != 0x80:
            return max_pos
        max_pos -= 1
    return 0
```

## Success Criteria

### Memory Test
```python
# Must pass this test
async def test_memory_bounded():
    # Process 10GB file
    file_path = "test_10gb.txt"
    
    # Monitor memory
    import psutil
    process = psutil.Process()
    initial_memory = process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024  # MB
    
    # Process file
    await stream_processor.process(file_path)
    
    # Check memory stayed bounded
    peak_memory = process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024  # MB
    assert peak_memory - initial_memory < 100  # Less than 100MB increase
```

### Checklist
- [ ] Process 10GB file with <100MB memory
- [ ] No UTF-8 corruption
- [ ] Checkpoint/resume working
- [ ] Progress events every second
- [ ] All 6 strategies adapted
- [ ] Output identical to non-streaming

## Resource Allocation

| Ticket | Agent Type | Time | Complexity |
|--------|-----------|------|------------|
| STREAM-001 | AsyncIO Expert | 3 days | High |
| STREAM-002 | Streaming Expert | 2 days | Medium |

## Phase Handoff

After completion:
- Phase 4 (Refactoring) can begin
- System can handle production-scale documents
- Memory issues completely resolved
