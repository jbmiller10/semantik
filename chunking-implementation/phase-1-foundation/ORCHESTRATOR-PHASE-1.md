# Phase 1: Foundation Refactoring - Orchestrator Guide

**Phase Duration**: 5 days  
**Phase Priority**: HIGH  
**Agent Requirements**: 2 agents with DDD/Clean Architecture expertise  
**Can Start**: After Phase 0 completes  

## Phase Overview

This phase establishes proper architectural boundaries using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. We're extracting business logic from the 2100+ line monolithic service and creating clean, testable layers.

## Critical Context

ðŸš¨ **PRE-RELEASE APPLICATION** - We can completely restructure the codebase without maintaining the old architecture. Delete the monolithic service and build proper layers from scratch.

## Ticket Execution Order

### Parallel Execution
Both tickets can be worked on simultaneously by different agents:
- `TICKET-ARCH-001.md` - Extract Domain Layer (Agent A - DDD Expert)
- `TICKET-ARCH-002.md` - Create Application Layer (Agent B - Clean Architecture Expert)

## Dependencies

- **External**: Phase 0 must be complete
- **Internal**: Both tickets can reference each other's interfaces but don't need full implementation

## Success Criteria

### Architecture Validation
```python
# Domain layer purity check
import ast
import os

def check_domain_purity():
    domain_path = "packages/shared/chunking/domain"
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(domain_path):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.py'):
                with open(os.path.join(root, file)) as f:
                    tree = ast.parse(f.read())
                    for node in ast.walk(tree):
                        if isinstance(node, ast.Import):
                            # Should not import infrastructure
                            assert 'sqlalchemy' not in node.names
                            assert 'redis' not in node.names
                            assert 'fastapi' not in node.names
    return True
```

### Checklist
- [ ] Domain layer has zero infrastructure dependencies
- [ ] All business rules moved to value objects
- [ ] Use cases clearly defined (one per file)
- [ ] Old monolithic service DELETED
- [ ] All tests still passing
- [ ] New structure follows DDD principles

## Resource Allocation

| Ticket | Agent Type | Estimated Time | Complexity |
|--------|------------|----------------|------------|
| ARCH-001 | DDD Expert | 2 days | Medium |
| ARCH-002 | Clean Architecture Expert | 2 days | Medium |

## Communication Between Agents

Since both agents work in parallel, they should:
1. Define interfaces first (morning of Day 1)
2. Share interface definitions via comments in code
3. Mock dependencies for testing
4. Integrate on Day 3

### Interface Agreement Template
```python
# domain/services/chunking_strategies/base.py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class ChunkingStrategy(ABC):
    """Interface agreed between ARCH-001 and ARCH-002"""
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def chunk(self, content: str, config: ChunkConfig) -> List[Chunk]:
        """Break content into chunks based on strategy"""
        pass
```

## Files to Delete

**IMPORTANT**: These files should be DELETED, not refactored:
- `packages/webui/services/chunking_service.py` (2100+ lines)
- `packages/webui/services/chunking_validator.py` (mixed concerns)
- Any file with mixed domain/infrastructure logic

## Validation Steps

1. **Check domain purity**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/check_domain_purity.py
   # Should report: "Domain layer is pure âœ“"
   ```

2. **Run architecture tests**:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/architecture/ -v
   # All architecture rule tests should pass
   ```

3. **Verify old code deleted**:
   ```bash
   ls packages/webui/services/chunking_service.py
   # Should return: "No such file or directory"
   ```

## Phase Handoff

After this phase completes:
- Phase 2 (Streaming) can begin immediately
- Infrastructure layer will connect domain to databases
- API layer will use application use cases
- All business logic will be testable in isolation

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Issues:
1. **Infrastructure leakage** - Watch for database imports in domain
2. **Anemic domain** - Ensure business logic is IN the domain, not around it
3. **Over-abstraction** - Keep it simple, don't create unnecessary layers

### Escalation Triggers:
- If agents disagree on interface design
- If tests fail after refactoring
- If performance degrades significantly

## Success Message Template

```
Phase 1 Complete: Foundation Refactoring
âœ… Domain layer extracted (0 infrastructure deps)
âœ… Application layer created (5 use cases)
âœ… Monolithic service deleted (removed 2100 lines)
âœ… All tests passing
âœ… Architecture rules enforced
Ready for Phase 2: Streaming Implementation
```

## Notes for Agents

- **Start with interfaces** - Define contracts before implementation
- **Delete, don't wrap** - Remove old code entirely
- **Test in isolation** - Domain should be testable without any infrastructure
- **Keep it simple** - Don't over-engineer the solution
