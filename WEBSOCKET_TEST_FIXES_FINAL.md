# Final WebSocket Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

Based on the test failures in `test_tasks_websocket_integration.py` and `test_websocket_manager.py`, the following issues were identified and fixed:

### 1. Async Context Manager Issues in test_tasks_websocket_integration.py

**Problem:** The `CeleryTaskWithOperationUpdates` class uses an async context manager pattern, but tests were not properly handling the async context.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Modified all tests to create the updater instance before using it in the async context
- Changed from `async with CeleryTaskWithOperationUpdates("op-id") as updater:` to:
  ```python
  updater = CeleryTaskWithOperationUpdates("op-id")
  async with updater:
  ```
- Ensured proper cleanup with `await updater.close()` in finally blocks for standalone tests

### 2. Fixture Cleanup Issues in test_websocket_manager.py

**Problem:** The fixture cleanup was attempting to handle async tasks in a synchronous context, causing cleanup failures.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Changed the `manager` fixture to use `asyncio.wait()` for batch task cancellation instead of individual waits
- Simplified the cleanup logic to avoid nested async operations
- Changed `cleanup_singleton` fixture from sync to async using `@pytest_asyncio.fixture`

### 3. Mock Redis Client Configuration

**Problem:** The mock Redis client was not properly configured as an async mock.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Changed from `MagicMock(spec=redis.Redis)` to `AsyncMock(spec=redis.Redis)`
- Ensured all Redis methods are properly mocked as AsyncMock instances

## Files Modified

1. `tests/webui/test_tasks_websocket_integration.py`:
   - Fixed 7 test methods to properly handle async context managers
   - Updated fixture to remove the updater parameter pattern
   - Added proper cleanup in standalone test methods

2. `tests/webui/test_websocket_manager.py`:
   - Updated `manager` fixture for better async cleanup
   - Changed `cleanup_singleton` to async fixture
   - Improved mock_redis fixture configuration

## Key Patterns Established

1. **Async Context Manager Usage:**
   ```python
   updater = CeleryTaskWithOperationUpdates("operation-id")
   async with updater:
       # Use updater here
   ```

2. **Fixture Cleanup Pattern:**
   ```python
   @pytest_asyncio.fixture
   async def manager(self):
       manager = RedisStreamWebSocketManager()
       yield manager
       # Async cleanup with proper timeout handling
   ```

3. **Task Cancellation Pattern:**
   ```python
   await asyncio.wait(tasks_to_cancel, timeout=0.5, return_when=asyncio.ALL_COMPLETED)
   ```

## Testing Verification

After these fixes, the WebSocket-related tests should pass. The fixes ensure:
- Proper async context manager lifecycle management
- Clean task cancellation during test cleanup
- No hanging async operations after tests complete
- Proper Redis mock configuration for async operations

## Remaining Considerations

1. Ensure all async operations are properly awaited
2. Use AsyncMock consistently for all async methods
3. Handle cleanup timeouts gracefully to prevent test hangs
4. Always cancel and await async tasks during cleanup
