## Recommended Action Plan

1. **Immediate Focus**: 
   - Fix React state management (Ticket #002) as it blocks all UI testing
   - Implement re-indexing (Ticket #001) as it's a core architectural feature

2. **Secondary Priority**:
   - Fix Qdrant persistence (Ticket #003)
   - Fix status inconsistency (Ticket #004)

3. **Polish Phase**:
   - Address all issues in Ticket #005 during final testing

## Review Outcome
**Status**: YELLOW - Halt and address major blockers

The refactor has successfully transformed the architecture from job-centric to collection-centric, but critical features are missing or broken. These must be addressed before proceeding to Phase 6 testing.
