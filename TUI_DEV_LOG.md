# TUI Development Log

## Session Start: 2025-01-07

### Initial Analysis
- Analyzed existing Docker setup:
  - Found `Dockerfile` with multi-stage build
  - Found `docker-compose.yml` (GPU-enabled by default)
  - Found `docker-compose-cpu-only.yml` (CPU version)
  - Found `docker-compose.prod.yml` (production overrides)
  - Found `.env.docker.example` template
  - Analyzed `make docker-up` target which:
    - Creates .env from template if missing
    - Auto-generates JWT secret key
    - Starts services with docker compose

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Added TUI Dependencies (✅ COMPLETED)
- **File**: `pyproject.toml`
- **Changes**: Added `questionary = "^2.0.1"` and `rich = "^13.0.0"`
- **Status**: Successfully added dependencies

#### 2. Created docker_setup_tui.py (✅ COMPLETED)
- **File**: `docker_setup_tui.py`
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Created `DockerSetupTUI` class with complete flow
  - Implemented all 8 steps from the plan:
    1. Welcome screen with ASCII art
    2. System checks (Docker, docker-compose, GPU)
    3. Deployment type selection
    4. Directory configuration
    5. Model and GPU settings
    6. Security configuration
    7. Configuration review
    8. Docker execution
  - Added proper error handling and keyboard interrupt support
  - Implemented .env file generation from template
  - Added progress indicators for Docker commands

### Design Decisions

1. **Single File Implementation**: Kept everything in one file for simplicity
2. **Class-Based Structure**: Used a class to maintain state throughout the wizard
3. **Configuration Storage**: Store all settings in a dict, then write to .env at the end
4. **GPU Detection**: Use nvidia-smi to detect GPU availability
5. **Docker Compose Detection**: Check both new (`docker compose`) and old (`docker-compose`) syntax
6. **Backup Strategy**: Always backup existing .env before overwriting

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Make the script executable
2. ✅ Add docker-setup target to Makefile
3. Test the complete flow
4. Run formatting and type checking
5. Update documentation

### Additional Actions Taken

#### 3. Made Script Executable (✅ COMPLETED)
- Ran `chmod +x docker_setup_tui.py`

#### 4. Added Makefile Target (✅ COMPLETED)
- **File**: `Makefile`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added `docker-setup` to help text
  - Added `docker-setup` target that runs `python docker_setup_tui.py`
- **Location**: Added before the existing `docker-up` target

#### 5. Code Formatting and Type Checking (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Formatting**:
  - Ran `make format` on existing code (no changes needed)
  - Ran `black` and `isort` on `docker_setup_tui.py`
  - Fixed missing newline at end of file
- **Type Checking**:
  - Fixed missing type annotations in `__init__` and `main`
  - All type checks pass successfully

### Current Status

All implementation tasks completed! The TUI is ready for testing.

### Summary of Created/Modified Files

2. **Interactive Configuration**:
   - Deployment type (GPU/CPU)
   - Directory mappings with validation
   - Model selection and quantization
   - Security settings (JWT, tokens, logging)
3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Generates .env from template
   - Backs up existing .env files
   - Validates all inputs
4. **Docker Execution**:
   - Build, start, or both options
   - Progress indicators
   - Service status checking
   - Option to view logs

### Ready for Testing

The TUI is now ready to be tested. Users can run:
```bash
make docker-setup
```

Or directly:
```bash
poetry run python docker_setup_tui.py
```

### Troubleshooting Session 1

#### Issue: ModuleNotFoundError for questionary
- **Problem**: Running `make docker-setup` failed with ModuleNotFoundError
- **Cause**: The script was being run outside the Poetry virtual environment
- **Solution**: 
  1. Updated Makefile to use `poetry run python docker_setup_tui.py`
  2. Ran `poetry lock` to update lock file with new dependencies
  3. Ran `poetry install` to install all dependencies

#### Fix Applied:
```makefile
docker-setup:
	@echo "Starting Semantik Docker Setup Wizard..."
	@poetry run python docker_setup_tui.py
```

### Enhancement Session 1: File Browser for Directory Selection

#### User Request
- Make directory selection more intuitive
- Support multiple directories
- Add a "file browser" experience

#### Implementation Details

1. **Enhanced `configure_directories` method**:
   - Added choice between file browser mode and manual entry
   - Support for selecting multiple directories
   - Shows selected directories as user adds them
   - Directory preview shows document files found

2. **Added `_browse_for_directory` method**:
   - Interactive directory navigation
   - Shows current location
   - Options to:
     - Select current directory
     - Go up one level
     - Navigate to subdirectories
     - Type path manually
     - Cancel selection
   - Uses emoji icons for better visual clarity

3. **Added `_preview_directory_contents` method**:
   - Shows preview of document files in selected directory
   - Lists first 5 files with supported extensions
   - Helps user confirm they selected the right directory

4. **Configuration Storage**:
   - Stores all selected paths in `DOCUMENT_PATHS` (colon-separated)
   - Uses first path as `DOCUMENT_PATH` for Docker compatibility
   - Shows warning about current Docker limitation

5. **Review Screen Updates**:
   - Shows all selected directories in the configuration table
   - Marks primary directory clearly

#### Technical Notes
- Current Docker compose only supports single volume mount
- Future enhancement: Modify docker-compose to support multiple mounts
- All formatting and type checking pass

### Potential Issues to Watch

1. **Poetry Dependencies**: Need to run `poetry install` after adding new dependencies
2. **Permissions**: Script needs appropriate permissions to create directories
3. **Docker Permissions**: User needs to be in docker group or use sudo
4. **Platform Differences**: May need to handle Windows differently
5. **Multiple Directory Support**: Currently only primary directory is mounted in Docker

### Enhancement Session 2: Configuration Persistence & Service Monitor

#### User Request
- Save configuration and detect existing configs
- Ask user if they want to use existing config or create new
- Add service monitor interface for managing running services

#### Implementation Details

1. **Configuration Detection** (`_check_existing_config`):
   - Checks for `.env` or `.semantik-config.json`
   - Presents options: use existing, create new, or exit
   
2. **Configuration Persistence**:
   - Saves to both `.env` and `.semantik-config.json`
   - JSON file stores all settings for easy reload
   - Added `.semantik-config.json` to `.gitignore`

3. **Configuration Loading** (`_load_existing_config`):
   - Loads from both `.env` and JSON config
   - Auto-detects GPU/CPU mode from existing setup

4. **Service Monitor Interface** (`_service_monitor`):
   - Real-time service status display with color coding
   - Management options:
     - Start/Stop/Restart all services
     - Rebuild and start
     - View logs (all or specific service)
     - Health checks with endpoint testing
     - Refresh status
   - Interactive loop with clear screen updates

5. **Service Status Display** (`_show_service_status`):
   - Uses Docker Compose JSON format for detailed info
   - Shows service state, ports, and health
   - Color-coded status indicators
   - Fallback to simple output if JSON parsing fails

6. **Health Monitoring** (`_check_service_health`):
   - Tests actual health endpoints
   - Shows pass/fail for each service
   - Handles connection errors gracefully

#### Technical Implementation
- Import `json` module for config persistence
- Added import for `requests` (lazy import for health checks)
- Proper error handling throughout
- Type hints maintained

### Enhancement Session 3: Smart Service Start/Restart

#### User Request
- When services are already running and user selects "Start all services", restart them instead

#### Implementation Details

1. **Added `_are_services_running` method**:
   - Checks if any services are currently running
   - Uses Docker Compose JSON format for accurate detection
   - Fallback to simple ps -q if JSON parsing fails

2. **Modified "Start all services" behavior**:
   - Now checks if services are running before starting
   - If running: performs docker-compose down, then up (full restart)
   - If not running: just starts normally
   - Shows user feedback about restart action

#### Technical Details
- Reuses compose file detection logic
- Proper error handling with fallback
- Maintains consistent user experience

### Enhancement Session 4: Major User-Friendliness Improvements

#### User Request
- Make the setup wizard more user-friendly (excluding model name simplification)

#### Implemented Improvements

1. **Quick Setup Mode** (✅ COMPLETED):
   - Added choice between "Quick Setup" and "Custom Setup"
   - Quick setup uses all sensible defaults
   - Only asks for document directory
   - Auto-detects GPU/CPU
   - Shows all applied settings for transparency

2. **Progress Indicators** (✅ COMPLETED):
   - Added step counter (Step X of 5)
   - Visual progress bar using Unicode characters
   - Clear indication of current position in setup flow

3. **Better Error Messages** (✅ COMPLETED):
   - Platform-specific Docker installation instructions
   - Commands for different Linux distributions
   - Reminder about docker group on Linux
   - Clear next steps for resolution

4. **Auto-Detection of Directories** (✅ COMPLETED):
   - Scans common locations (~/Documents, ~/Downloads, etc.)
   - Shows document count for each found directory
   - Offers found directories as quick selection options
   - Falls back to browser if none found

5. **Examples and Help Text** (✅ COMPLETED):
   - Added examples for directory paths
   - GPU configuration shows recommendations
   - Validation for numeric inputs
   - Context-sensitive help messages

6. **Port Availability Check** (✅ COMPLETED):
   - Checks all required ports before starting
   - Shows which service uses each port
   - Provides commands to find blocking processes
   - Offers to stop existing Semantik containers

#### Technical Implementation
- Added `_show_progress()` method for consistent progress display
- Added `_detect_common_directories()` for intelligent directory discovery
- Added `_count_documents()` to preview directory contents
- Added `_check_ports()` for pre-flight validation
- Added `_quick_setup()` for streamlined configuration
- Enhanced error messages with platform detection
- Added input validation for numeric fields

### Future Enhancement Ideas

#### Still To Do
1. **Import/Export configs** - Share configurations between team members
2. **Resource checks** - Warn if system doesn't have enough RAM/disk space
3. **Disk space validation** - Check available space before Docker build
4. **Health check visualization** - Better display during startup

### Enhancement Session 5: Rename Make Target

#### User Request
- Change make target from `docker-setup` to `wizard` for better clarity

#### Implementation
- Updated help text in Makefile from `docker-setup` to `wizard`
- Renamed the target itself from `docker-setup:` to `wizard:`
- No changes needed to the Python script itself

#### Usage
Users can now run:
```bash
make wizard
```

This is more intuitive and shorter than `docker-setup`.

### Enhancement Session 6: Self-Installing Wizard

#### User Request
- Make the wizard handle dependency installation automatically

#### Implementation

1. **Created `wizard.sh`** - Bash wrapper script that:
   - Checks Python version (3.12+)
   - Installs Poetry if not present
   - Installs dependencies if needed
   - Launches the wizard

2. **Created `wizard_launcher.py`** - Python fallback that:
   - Works without any external dependencies
   - Can bootstrap Poetry installation
   - Handles dependency installation
   - Provides user-friendly prompts

3. **Updated Makefile**:
   - `make wizard` now uses the wrapper script
   - No need for users to run `poetry install` first

4. **Updated README**:
   - Removed `poetry install` step
   - Documented automatic dependency handling

#### Benefits
- Zero-dependency start - just clone and run `make wizard`
- Automatic Poetry installation if needed
- Clear error messages for missing prerequisites
- Works on systems without Poetry pre-installed

### Enhancement Session 7: Cross-Platform Support

#### User Request
- Noted that different platforms need different launcher scripts

#### Implementation

1. **Created platform-specific launchers**:
   - `wizard.sh` - Bash script for Linux/macOS
   - `wizard.bat` - Batch script for Windows CMD
   - `wizard.ps1` - PowerShell script for Windows

2. **Enhanced `wizard_launcher.py`**:
   - Added platform detection
   - Searches common Poetry installation paths per platform
   - Platform-specific Poetry installation instructions
   - Works as universal fallback

3. **Simplified Makefile**:
   - Now just calls Python launcher
   - Works on all platforms with Python

4. **Updated README**:
   - Added Windows-specific instructions
   - Clarified cross-platform support

#### Key Improvements
- Single Python launcher works everywhere
- Detects Poetry in platform-specific locations
- Handles Windows path differences
- Clear instructions per platform
