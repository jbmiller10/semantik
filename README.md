**Semantik is a self-hosted search engine that turns your personal or team's file server into a powerful, private knowledge base. Find what you need instantly, without your data ever leaving your hardware.**

No cloud APIs, no subscriptions, no vendor lock-in. Just powerful, open-source search you control completely.

## Why Semantik? Find Your Files Without Sacrificing Privacy.

Commercial search solutions are powerful, but they require you to upload your sensitive data to their servers. Open-source libraries are private, but they require you to build an entire application from scratch.

Semantik gives you the best of both worlds: a production-ready application that runs entirely on your own hardware.

| Semantik is for you if... | You might not need Semantik if... |
| :--- | :--- |
| ✅ You have a large collection of documents on a NAS or local server. | ❌ All your data is already in a cloud service you like. |
| ✅ You value privacy and want to keep your data 100% in-house. | ❌ You prefer a fully managed, hands-off solution. |
| ✅ You want the power of modern AI-powered search. | ❌ You only need simple keyword search. |
| ✅ You're a technical user who likes to tune and control your software. | ❌ You don't want to manage your own server/application. |
