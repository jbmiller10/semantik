**Evaluating planning approach under read-only constraints**

I'm figuring out how to create an execution plan for ENG-002 considering read-only access—no file changes allowed. Since the task seems moderately complex, I’m leaning toward a manual plan instead of a formal planning tool, which may not even be available. I’ll start by inspecting the repo structure to locate the relevant ticket and doc references using shell commands in the appropriate directory.

# Semantik Chunking Feature - Overview & Context

## Executive Summary

This document provides context for all developers working on Semantik's chunking system implementation. We're building a modern, intelligent document chunking system that will form the foundation of Semantik's semantic search capabilities.

**Timeline**: 4 weeks (includes buffer for unexpected issues)  
**Approach**: Clean implementation with enhanced architecture based on review feedback  
**Goal**: World-class document chunking supporting 6 strategies across 40+ file types  
**Code Support**: Deferred to follow-up release (~2 weeks post-launch)

---

## Why Chunking Matters

### The Problem
When storing documents in a vector database for semantic search, we need to split them into smaller, meaningful pieces called "chunks". Poor chunking leads to:
- 🔍 **Bad search results**: Relevant content is missed or buried
- 💭 **Lost context**: Important information is split across chunks
- 💰 **Wasted resources**: Inefficient chunks increase costs and reduce performance

- **Seamless Migration**: Re-chunk collections automatically

### Why Defer Code Support?
1. **Complexity**: Code chunking requires language-specific parsing
2. **Quality**: Better to do it right than rush it
3. **Insights**: Learn from real usage patterns first
4. **Speed**: Ship core features faster

---

## For Developers

### Key Principles
1. **Security First**: Validate everything, trust nothing
2. **Performance Matters**: Benchmark early and often
3. **Error Handling**: Plan for failure at every step
4. **Clean Architecture**: Maintain separation of concerns
5. **Test Everything**: Edge cases matter
6. **Document as You Go**: Future you will thank present you
7. **Communicate Roadmap**: Be clear about what's coming

# Semantik Chunking Strategies - Implementation Plan (No Legacy, No Agentic, No Code)

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan reflects the decision to defer code-specific chunking to a follow-up release, with improvements based on architectural review feedback. We're implementing 6 core strategies in 4 weeks (with buffer), with code files handled by optimized recursive chunking until dedicated code support arrives ~2 weeks post-launch.

**Timeline**: 4 weeks (was 3.5 - added buffer)  
**Strategies**: 6 (character, recursive, markdown, semantic, hierarchical, hybrid)  
**Code Support**: Deferred to follow-up release

I'll structure the plan into Discovery, Implementation (with subtasks), Testing & Validation, and cross-team coordination, plus mention concurrency tasks like reviewing chunking modules. To accurately reference docs with line numbers, I plan to number the docs using commands to grab relevant line ranges before quoting. This way, I can confidently cite exact locations for the user’s clarity.

     3	## Executive Summary
     4	
     5	This implementation plan reflects the decision to defer code-specific chunking to a follow-up release, with improvements based on architectural review feedback. We're implementing 6 core strategies in 4 weeks (with buffer), with code files handled by optimized recursive chunking until dedicated code support arrives ~2 weeks post-launch.
     6	
     7	**Timeline**: 4 weeks (was 3.5 - added buffer)  
     8	**Strategies**: 6 (character, recursive, markdown, semantic, hierarchical, hybrid)  
     9	**Code Support**: Deferred to follow-up release

**Drafting detailed execution plan**

I’m putting together a step-by-step plan covering discovery, implementation, testing, and rollout phases, referencing relevant docs and code files with line numbers. I’ll note we couldn’t find the ticket in the repo but formed the plan from documentation. The plan will outline verifying chunking strategies, database migrations, API updates, async processing, and metrics validation, while keeping it clear and approachable.
[2025-10-17T23:36:33] codex

**Execution Plan**

- Ticket artifact missing: `find . -name '*ENG-002*'` returned nothing, so scope is inferred from the chunking strategy docs and existing service code. Primary references are `docs/CHUNKING_FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md:1-200` for roadmap/context and `docs/CHUNKING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:1-204` for detailed task breakdown.

**Discovery**

- Align with product/UX on success metrics defined in the overview (e.g., 6 strategies, 40+ file types, performance targets) and capture any deltas versus current code `packages/shared/text_processing/base_chunker.py:1-120` and `packages/webui/services/chunking_service.py:1-200`.
- Inventory present chunking flows in the API (`packages/webui/api/v2/chunking.py`, `packages/webui/services/chunking_service.py:1-200`) and background workers (`packages/webui/chunking_tasks.py`) to map existing behavior against doc expectations.
- Confirm database state and migrations under `alembic/versions/` to see what schema work remains relative to the normalized model outlined in `docs/CHUNKING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:205-400` (schema section).

**Implementation Track 1 – Core Architecture & Strategies**

- Harden `BaseChunker` and strategy wrappers (`packages/shared/text_processing/base_chunker.py:1-120`, `packages/shared/text_processing/chunking_factory.py:1-120`, `packages/shared/text_processing/strategies/*.py`) to match the plan’s interface guarantees (sync/async, validation, estimation).
- Build/verify the `ChunkingFactory` parameter handling for semantic/hybrid strategies with proper embedding injection (`packages/shared/text_processing/chunking_factory.py:32-80`).
- Ensure the service layer (`packages/webui/services/chunking_service.py:164-200`) enforces security guardrails, caching, and config normalization per plan Task 1.1/1.2.

**Implementation Track 2 – Advanced Strategies & Integration**

- Confirm semantic, hierarchical, and hybrid strategies honor LlamaIndex defaults/config hooks (files under `packages/shared/text_processing/strategies/`), adding hybrid routing logic for markdown-aware detection.
- Extend API/dto layers (`packages/webui/services/dtos/chunking_dtos.py`, `packages/webui/api/v2/chunking.py`) to expose new strategy options, preview metadata, and analytics required by the overview doc.
- Wire async processing: review Celery/Redis usage in `packages/webui/chunking_tasks.py` and update queue prioritization, retry, and recovery flows in `packages/webui/services/chunking_error_handler.py` according to Task 1.2.
- Implement or finish normalized schema migrations and repositories under `packages/shared/database/repositories/` based on the schema blueprint in `docs/CHUNKING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:240-400`, including partitioned chunks tables and metrics collection.
- Update configuration builders and security checks (`packages/webui/services/chunking_config_builder.py`, `packages/webui/services/chunking_security.py:205-240`) to support new params and bounds.

**Implementation Track 3 – Analytics, Monitoring, UX**

- Flesh out metrics pipelines (`packages/webui/services/chunking_metrics.py`, `packages/webui/services/chunking_error_metrics.py`) so the system can report strategy performance and error trends expected in the overview.
- Add webhook/WebSocket progress streaming hooks if missing (check `packages/webui/services/chunking_service.py` and related notifier modules).
- Coordinate frontend adjustments in `apps/webui-react/` (strategy selection UI, analytics dashboards) once API schema stabilizes.

**Testing & Validation**

- Unit-test each strategy (happy path + edge cases) under `tests/domain` using fixtures for different file types; include mock embeddings for semantic/hybrid paths.
- Expand integration tests for collection operations (`packages/webui/tests/test_collection_service_chunking_validation.py`) to cover new configs, error handling, and security validations.
- Implement performance benchmarks under `tests/performance/` following the scaffold in `docs/CHUNKING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:137-220`, validating throughput/memory targets from `docs/CHUNKING_FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md:116-124`.
- Run async workflow/e2e tests for queue handling and partial-failure recovery to match Task 1.2 expectations.
- Capture manual validation scenarios in `manual_tests/` or similar, reflecting Week 4 readiness checks (security audit, deployment rehearsal).

**Documentation & Rollout**

- Update user-facing docs (likely `docs/` and `README.md`) to describe strategy capabilities, tuning parameters, and code-support roadmap (~2 weeks post-launch per `docs/CHUNKING_FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md:81-88`).
- Provide internal runbooks for operations (monitoring dashboards, alert thresholds, recovery playbooks) aligning with success criteria and risk mitigation in the overview.
- Schedule review checkpoints after each phase (Weeks 1-3) with stakeholders to gate progression, mirroring the milestone cadence in `docs/CHUNKING_FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md:128-195`.

Next step from here: sync with product/engineering to validate inferred requirements and confirm whether any hidden ENG-002 acceptance criteria exist before implementation begins.
