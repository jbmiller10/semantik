A text or call from someone you know is proven to turnout someone over 10% more than a cold touch, and everyone we know across the country likely has roots, community, and family across the country as well. Community spans across borders-- a volunteer in Flagstaff, Arizona may cold-call a target voter in Phoenix 5x to get a response, while their college roommate in New York can get through in mere minutes. Finally, we do not know the community everyone we know has: it is possible that your dear ones in New York may have gone to university in Ann Arbor, have aunts and uncles in Maine, and have lived for 2 years in Minneapolis for work. To win, we need everyone we know to reach out to the people they know, and turnout their communities and to complete a volunteer shift that turns out their communities to vote .","metadata":{"filename":"Relational Voter Contact_ Guide.docx","file_type":"docx","page_number":1,"has_coordinates":"True"},"file_name":"Relational Voter Contact_ Guide.docx","file_path":"/mnt/docs/Relational Voter Contact_ Guide.docx","collection_id":"bdaa21ae-1f7a-4fec-b85c-3374a6e5f96b","collection_name":"medocs","original_score":0.98193359375,"reranked_score":null,"embedding_model":""},{"document_id":"306c568a-e045-4998-9818-d3052138adbb","chunk_id":"306c568a-e045-4998-9818-d3052138adbb_0000","score":0.98095703125,"text":"Add a relational voter contact mini-shift with your dialer, textbank, and organizing meeting shifts.
