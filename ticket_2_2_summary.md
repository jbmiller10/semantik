# Ticket 2.2 Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Added httpx Import
- Added `import httpx` to enable HTTP API calls to vecpipe service

### 2. Removed GPU-related Imports
- Removed `from shared.embedding import embedding_service`
- Removed `from shared.gpu_scheduler import gpu_task`

### 3. Replaced Embedding Generation Calls
Replaced direct `embedding_service.generate_embeddings()` calls with HTTP POST requests to `http://vecpipe:8000/embed`:

- **In `_process_append_operation`** (lines 1467-1485):
  - Constructs `EmbedRequest` with texts, model_name, quantization, instruction, and batch_size
  - Uses httpx.AsyncClient with 300s timeout for long-running embedding operations
  - Handles API response and extracts embeddings from JSON response

- **In `_process_reindex_operation`** (lines 1820-1838):
  - Similar implementation for reindex operations
  - Same request structure following the EmbedRequest schema

### 4. Replaced Qdrant Upsert Calls
Replaced direct `qdrant_client.upsert()` calls with HTTP POST requests to `http://vecpipe:8000/upsert`:

- **In `_process_append_operation`** (lines 1509-1534):
  - Converts PointStruct objects to dictionary format for API
  - Constructs `UpsertRequest` with collection_name, points, and wait flag
  - Uses httpx.AsyncClient with 60s timeout

- **In `_process_reindex_operation`** (lines 1883-1905):
  - Same conversion and request structure
  - Maintains the QdrantOperationTimer wrapper for metrics

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Error Handling**: Each API call includes proper error handling with descriptive error messages
2. **Timeouts**: 
   - 300s timeout for embedding operations (can be long-running)
   - 60s timeout for upsert operations
3. **Data Conversion**: 
   - Embeddings are now received as lists from API (no .tolist() conversion needed)
   - PointStruct objects are converted to dictionaries for JSON serialization
4. **Logging**: Added informative log messages for API calls

## Verification Results
All acceptance criteria have been met:
- ✓ No direct embedding or Qdrant upsert logic remains in tasks.py
- ✓ All operations are performed via API calls to vecpipe
- ✓ The worker service no longer has knowledge of GPU operations
- ✓ API calls follow the Pydantic schemas defined in Ticket 2.1

The overall functionality remains intact - the worker now orchestrates operations through vecpipe's API instead of performing them directly.
