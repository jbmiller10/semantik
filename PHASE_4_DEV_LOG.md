# Phase 4 Development Log

This log tracks the implementation progress of Phase 4 tasks in the Collections Refactor project.

## TASK-015: Create Collection API Routes
**Started:** 2025-07-17
**Developer:** Backend Developer

### Initial Analysis
- Reviewed existing codebase structure
- Confirmed dependencies TASK-005 (Collection Repository) and TASK-006 (Collection Service) are complete
- Identified that old job-centric API exists at `/api/collections`
- Found all necessary models, repositories, services, and schemas already implemented

### Implementation Plan
1. Create new v2 API structure to avoid breaking existing functionality
2. Implement RESTful collection endpoints using new collection-centric models
3. Leverage existing CollectionService for business logic
4. Use get_collection_for_user dependency for authorization

### Progress Log

#### 2025-07-17 - Initial Setup
- Created this development log
- Created comprehensive todo list for tracking implementation
- Beginning implementation of v2 API structure

#### 2025-07-17 - Collections API Implementation
- Created v2 API directory structure at `packages/webui/api/v2/`
- Implemented comprehensive collections.py with:
  - CRUD endpoints: POST, GET (list), GET (single), PUT, DELETE
  - Collection operation endpoints: add_source, remove_source, reindex
  - Additional endpoints: list_operations, list_documents
- Added OperationResponse schema to schemas.py
- All endpoints use proper dependency injection and error handling
- Leveraged existing CollectionService for business logic
- Used get_collection_for_user dependency for authorization

#### 2025-07-17 - Operations API and Integration
- Created operations.py with operation management endpoints:
  - GET /operations/{uuid} - Get operation details
  - DELETE /operations/{uuid} - Cancel operation  
  - GET /operations/ - List user's operations
- Updated main.py to include v2 API routers
- Maintained backward compatibility by keeping old API endpoints

#### 2025-07-17 - Code Quality and Fixes
- Fixed all mypy type errors:
  - Added type annotations for updates dict
  - Used str() casting for SQLAlchemy Column objects
  - Created from_collection method in CollectionResponse schema
  - Fixed status code constants to use numeric values
- Added get_collection_service dependency function to factory.py
- Fixed repository method name (list_by_collection)
- All code quality checks (black, ruff, mypy) passing
- All 427 tests passing

### Summary
Successfully implemented TASK-015 with comprehensive collection API routes. The new v2 API provides:
- Full CRUD operations for collections
- Collection operation endpoints (add source, remove source, reindex)
- Operation management endpoints
- Proper authorization using get_collection_for_user dependency
- Clean separation from legacy job-centric API

### Post-Implementation Enhancement
#### 2025-07-17 - Added Rate Limiting
Following user feedback, added rate limiting to expensive endpoints using slowapi:
- Create collection: 5 requests per hour
- Delete collection: 5 requests per hour  
- Add source: 10 requests per hour
- Remove source: 10 requests per hour
- Reindex collection: 1 request per 5 minutes

This prevents abuse and protects server resources from excessive operations.
