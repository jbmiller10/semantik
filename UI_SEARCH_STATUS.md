# Web UI Search Feature Status

## Current State

The web UI (`webui/app.py`) has **full Qwen3 support** and all the optimizations:

### ‚úÖ What's Already Working

1. **Qwen3 Models Available**: All three Qwen3 embedding models are available in the UI:
   - Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B (1024d) - Fast, good quality
   - Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-4B (2560d) - Balanced performance  
   - Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B (4096d) - Highest quality

2. **Quantization Support**: Users can select:
   - float32 (full precision)
   - float16 (half precision - recommended)
   - int8 (8-bit quantization - memory efficient)

3. **Task Instructions**: The UI supports custom instructions for better search:
   - Users can input task-specific instructions when creating jobs
   - Instructions are preserved and used during search

4. **Search Functionality**: 
   - Search tab in the UI works with real embeddings
   - Respects the model/quantization/instruction from the job that created the embeddings
   - Generates query embeddings with the same settings as the indexed documents

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Architecture Issue

The web UI duplicates the search logic instead of using the search API (`/api/search` in `app.py` vs `/search` in `search_api.py`). This means:

- Two separate search implementations to maintain
- The search API optimizations (like batch search) aren't available in the UI
- Potential for feature divergence

### üìä No Feature Bifurcation

There is **NO feature bifurcation** between CLI and UI for core functionality:
- Both use the same `embedding_service.py`
- Both support all Qwen3 models
- Both support quantization
- Both support task instructions

## How Users Access Qwen3 Features

1. **Creating a Job**:
   - Select any Qwen3 model from the dropdown
   - Choose quantization level (float16 recommended)
   - Optionally add a task instruction

2. **Searching**:
   - The search automatically uses the same model/settings as the job
   - Query embeddings are generated with matching configuration

## Recommendations

1. **For immediate use**: The UI is fully functional with Qwen3. Users can:
   - Select Qwen3 models when creating jobs
   - Use float16 quantization for best performance/quality balance
   - Add instructions like "Represent this document for retrieval:"

2. **Future improvement**: Consider refactoring the web UI to use the search API for:
   - Consistent implementation
   - Access to batch search
   - Easier maintenance

## Example Usage in UI

1. Go to "Create Job" tab
2. Select model: "Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B"
3. Set quantization: "float16"
4. Add instruction: "Represent this document for retrieval:"
5. Create the job
6. Once complete, go to "Search" tab
7. Search will automatically use Qwen3 with the same settings
