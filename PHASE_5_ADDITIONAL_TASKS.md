# Phase 5 Additional Tasks

Based on the Phase 5 review conducted on 2025-07-18, the following additional tasks are required to complete the frontend implementation:

## Critical Blockers (Must Fix)

### TASK-5H: Fix BCrypt Authentication Issue
**Priority:** P0 - Critical
**Type:** Bug Fix
**Assignee:** Backend Team

**Description:**
The authentication system is completely broken due to a bcrypt library compatibility issue. This prevents all UI testing and user access to the application.

**Error:**

AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute '__about__'
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Update bcrypt library to compatible version
- [ ] Test admin:admin login works
- [ ] Test user registration works
- [ ] All auth endpoints return proper responses

**Technical Notes:**
- Check passlib and bcrypt version compatibility
- May need to pin specific versions in requirements.txt
- Test thoroughly as this affects all user access

   - [ ] Verify collection appears in dashboard
   - [ ] Check progress updates during indexing

2. **Collection Management**
   - [ ] Add source to existing collection
   - [ ] Remove source from collection
   - [ ] Re-index collection with config changes
   - [ ] Delete collection

3. **Search Functionality**
   - [ ] Multi-collection search
   - [ ] Partial failure handling
   - [ ] Result grouping by collection
   - [ ] Cross-model reranking

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - [ ] WebSocket connection establishment

### TASK-5K: Performance Testing
**Priority:** P2 - Medium
**Type:** Testing
**Assignee:** QA Team

**Description:**
Test frontend performance with realistic data volumes.

**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] Dashboard with 100+ collections
- [ ] Search across 10+ collections
- [ ] Multiple concurrent operations
- [ ] WebSocket handling with 20+ active connections
- [ ] Memory usage over extended sessions

**Metrics to Capture:**
- Initial page load time

**Description:**
Add ability to export collection metadata and import collections from JSON.

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Export collection configuration as JSON
- [ ] Import collection from JSON file
- [ ] Validate imported configuration
- [ ] Handle conflicts with existing collections

---

### TASK-5M: Add Collection Templates
**Priority:** P3 - Low
**Type:** Feature
**Assignee:** Frontend Team

**Description:**
Provide pre-configured collection templates for common use cases.

**Template Examples:**

---

## Documentation Tasks

### TASK-5N: Update User Documentation
**Priority:** P2 - Medium
**Type:** Documentation
**Assignee:** Documentation Team

## Technical Debt

### TASK-5O: Add Frontend Telemetry
**Priority:** P3 - Low
**Type:** Enhancement
**Assignee:** Frontend Team

**Description:**
Implement frontend telemetry to track usage patterns and errors.

**Metrics to Track:**

- Error rates by component
- Performance metrics
- User journey analytics
- LocalStorage migration success rate

---

## Summary

**Critical Tasks (P0):** 2 - Must be completed before any testing
**High Priority (P1):** 1 - E2E testing once blockers fixed
**Medium Priority (P2):** 2 - Performance testing and documentation
**Low Priority (P3):** 3 - Enhancements and technical debt

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Critical fixes: 1-2 days
- Testing: 3-5 days
- Enhancements: 1-2 weeks (can be done post-release)

The most critical issue is the authentication failure which completely blocks all UI testing. This must be resolved immediately to unblock the rest of the Phase 5 validation.
