# Phase 5 Additional Tasks

**Created:** 2025-07-18  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Must complete before merge  
**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Context:** Phase 5 implemented a collection-centric UI refactor, but testing revealed critical issues preventing functionality

## Background

Phase 5 of the collections refactor aimed to transform Semantik's UI from a job-centric to collection-centric paradigm. The implementation is complete and well-architected, but during review we discovered a critical API contract mismatch between the frontend and backend that prevents the application from functioning.

The frontend was developed expecting one response structure while the backend returns a different structure. This is blocking all functionality as collections cannot load, preventing users from accessing any features.

## Task 5E: Fix Frontend-Backend API Contract Mismatch

**Priority:** 🚨 CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Blocker:** Yes - blocks all functionality  
**Assignee:** Frontend or Backend Developer

### Problem Context

During the v1 to v2 API migration, the frontend and backend teams appear to have implemented different response structures for paginated endpoints. This is a common issue when teams work in parallel without clearly defined API contracts.

**Current Situation:**
- User logs in successfully
- Navigate to Collections dashboard (the default landing page)
- Dashboard attempts to fetch collections via GET `/api/v2/collections`
- API returns 200 OK with data, but in unexpected format
- Frontend tries to access `response.data.items` which doesn't exist
- Results in "Failed to load collections" error
- Application is completely unusable

### Technical Details

**Backend Response Structure (Current):**
```json
{
  "collections": [          // ❌ Backend uses "collections" array
    {
      "id": "uuid-here",
      "name": "My Collection",
      // ... other fields
    }
  ],
  "total": 0,
  "page": 1,
  "per_page": 50           // ❌ Backend uses "per_page"
}
```

**Frontend Expected Structure:**
```json
{
  "items": [               // ✓ Frontend expects "items" array
    {
      "id": "uuid-here",
      "name": "My Collection",
      // ... other fields
    }
  ],
  "total": 0,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 50             // ✓ Frontend expects "limit"
}
```

### Investigation Starting Points

1. **Backend Response Definition:**
   - File: `packages/webui/api/schemas.py`
   - Look for: `CollectionListResponse` class
   - Current definition uses `collections: list[CollectionResponse]`

2. **Frontend Type Definition:**
   - File: `apps/webui-react/src/types/collection.ts`
   - Look for: `CollectionListResponse` interface
   - Current definition expects `items: Collection[]`

3. **Frontend Store Implementation:**
   - File: `apps/webui-react/src/stores/collectionStore.ts`
   - Line 72: `const collections = new Map(response.data.items.map(c => [c.id, c]));`
   - This line fails because `response.data.items` is undefined

### Solution Options

#### Option 1: Update Frontend to Match Backend (Recommended)

**Why Recommended:** 
- Backend is already deployed and working
- Less risk of breaking other services that might depend on the API
- Frontend changes are isolated to the UI layer

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1. **Update TypeScript Interfaces:**
   ```typescript
   // File: apps/webui-react/src/types/collection.ts
   
   // Change from:
   export interface CollectionListResponse {
     items: Collection[];
     total: number;
     page: number;
     limit: number;
   }
   
   // To:
   export interface CollectionListResponse {
     collections: Collection[];  // Changed from 'items'
     total: number;
     page: number;
     per_page: number;          // Changed from 'limit'
   }
   ```

2. **Update Collection Store:**
   ```typescript
   // File: apps/webui-react/src/stores/collectionStore.ts
   
   // Line 72, change from:
   const collections = new Map(response.data.items.map(c => [c.id, c]));
   
   // To:
   const collections = new Map(response.data.collections.map(c => [c.id, c]));
   ```

3. **Check Other Paginated Endpoints:**
   - Search for all uses of `items` and `limit` in the codebase
   - Other endpoints that might need updates:
     - `listOperations` response
     - `listDocuments` response
     - Any other paginated API calls

4. **Update Response Type Imports:**
   - Ensure all files importing `CollectionListResponse` are updated
   - Run TypeScript compiler to catch any missed updates

#### Option 2: Update Backend to Match Frontend

**When to Choose This:**
- If other services already depend on the frontend's expected structure
- If changing the backend is simpler for your team

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Update `packages/webui/api/schemas.py`
2. Change `collections` field to `items`
3. Change `per_page` field to `limit`
4. Update all endpoints returning paginated responses
5. Test all API consumers

### Testing Steps

1. **Immediate Verification:**
   ```bash
   # Start the application
   make dev
   
   # In browser console after login:
   fetch('/api/v2/collections', {
     headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
   }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log)
   
   # Verify the response structure
   ```

2. **Component Testing:**
   - Login to the application
   - Collections should load without error
   - Create a new collection
   - Verify it appears in the list
   - Check pagination if many collections exist

3. **TypeScript Validation:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/webui-react
   npm run type-check
   # Should pass without errors
   ```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Collections dashboard loads without "Failed to load collections" error
- [ ] API response structure matches frontend expectations
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] All paginated endpoints use consistent field names
- [ ] Create, update, delete operations work correctly

## Task 5F: WebSocket Integration Testing

**Priority:** HIGH  
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Blocker:** No - but required for full functionality  
**Assignee:** QA Engineer or Frontend Developer  
**Prerequisites:** Task 5E must be completed first

### Context

The Phase 5 implementation includes sophisticated WebSocket integration for real-time operation progress updates. This is a key differentiator for Semantik, providing users with live feedback as their documents are processed. However, we couldn't test this during the review due to the API mismatch preventing collection creation.

### Background on Implementation

The frontend has several components ready for WebSocket integration:

1. **useOperationProgress Hook** (`apps/webui-react/src/hooks/useOperationProgress.ts`):
   - Connects to `/ws/operations/{operationId}` endpoint
   - Updates collection store with progress messages
   - Handles connection lifecycle and reconnection
   - Provides callbacks for completion and error events

2. **OperationProgress Component** (`apps/webui-react/src/components/OperationProgress.tsx`):
   - Displays real-time progress bars with shimmer animation
   - Shows ETA calculations
   - Indicates live connection status
   - Handles different operation types (index, append, reindex, remove_source)

3. **Collection Store WebSocket Handlers**:
   - `updateOperationProgress` method updates operation state
   - `updateCollectionStatus` method updates collection status
   - Maintains `activeOperations` Set for efficient queries

### Test Environment Setup

1. **Ensure WebSocket Server is Running:**
   ```bash
   # Check if WebSocket endpoint is accessible
   curl -i -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" \
     http://localhost:8080/ws/operations/test
   ```

2. **Prepare Test Data:**
   - Have a directory with sample documents ready (e.g., `/data/test-docs`)
   - Ensure it contains various file types (PDF, TXT, MD)
   - Ideal size: 10-50 files for reasonable processing time

### Detailed Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Create Collection with Initial Source

**Purpose:** Verify the complete flow from collection creation through indexing completion

**Steps:**
1. Click "Create Collection" button
2. Fill in:
   - Name: "Test Real-time Updates"
   - Description: "Testing WebSocket integration"
   - Initial Source Directory: `/data/test-docs`
   - Leave other settings as default
3. Click "Create"
4. **Expected Behaviors:**
   - Modal closes and navigates to collection details page
   - Collection card shows "Processing" status with blue border
   - Progress bar appears showing indexing progress
   - Live indicator (pulsing dot) shows WebSocket is connected
   - Progress updates in real-time (e.g., "Processing document 5 of 20")
   - ETA updates as processing continues
   - Upon completion, status changes to "Ready" with green indicator
   - Document and vector counts update to final values

**What to Check in Browser DevTools:**
```javascript
// Network tab > WS
// Should see WebSocket connection to /ws/operations/{id}
// Messages should flow like:
// → {"type": "progress", "progress": 25, "message": "Processing document 5 of 20"}
// → {"type": "progress", "progress": 50, "message": "Processing document 10 of 20"}
// → {"type": "completed", "message": "Indexing completed successfully"}
```

#### Scenario 2: Add Source to Existing Collection

**Purpose:** Test incremental updates to an existing collection

**Steps:**
1. Open an existing collection's details panel
2. Click "Add Data" button
3. Enter a new source path with additional documents
4. Submit the form
5. **Expected Behaviors:**
   - New operation appears in the Operations History tab
   - Active Operations tab (in main navigation) shows the operation
   - Collection status changes to "Processing"
   - Existing documents remain searchable (collection stays "Ready" if blue-green is working)
   - Progress bar shows append operation progress
   - Document count increments as files are processed

#### Scenario 3: Reindex Collection

**Purpose:** Test the complex blue-green reindexing process

**Steps:**
1. Open collection settings tab
2. Change configuration (e.g., chunk_size from 1000 to 512)
3. Click "Re-index Collection"
4. Type confirmation text: "reindex [collection name]"
5. Confirm
6. **Expected Behaviors:**
   - Warning about temporary double storage usage
   - Collection shows "Reindexing" status
   - Progress shows "Creating staging environment..."
   - Then "Reindexing documents..."
   - Search continues to work during reindexing
   - Upon completion, seamless switch to new index
   - Old index cleaned up (verify in logs)

#### Scenario 4: Concurrent Operations

**Purpose:** Verify system handles multiple simultaneous operations

**Steps:**
1. Create 3 collections quickly in succession
2. Start operations on each:
   - Collection 1: Add new source
   - Collection 2: Reindex
   - Collection 3: Remove source
3. **Expected Behaviors:**
   - Active Operations tab shows all 3 operations
   - Each progress bar updates independently
   - No WebSocket message crosstalk
   - System remains responsive
   - Can still search while operations run

### Error Condition Testing

1. **WebSocket Disconnection:**
   - Start a long operation
   - Kill the WebSocket server mid-operation
   - **Expected:** Graceful degradation, status polling fallback

2. **Operation Failure:**
   - Try to index an invalid/inaccessible path
   - **Expected:** Error state shown, clear error message

3. **Network Interruption:**
   - Start operation
   - Disconnect network briefly
   - **Expected:** Reconnection attempt, operation continues

### Performance Metrics to Monitor

- WebSocket message frequency (should not overwhelm)
- UI responsiveness during updates
- Memory usage with multiple operations
- CPU usage on progress updates

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All WebSocket connections establish successfully
- [ ] Progress updates appear within 1 second of server sending
- [ ] No duplicate progress notifications
- [ ] Status transitions are smooth and accurate
- [ ] Multiple concurrent operations work independently
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] WebSocket reconnection works after disconnection
- [ ] No memory leaks during long operations

## Task 5G: Error State Testing

**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes  
**Blocker:** No  
**Assignee:** QA Engineer or Frontend Developer

### Context

Robust error handling is crucial for a good user experience. The Phase 5 implementation includes error boundaries, toast notifications, and retry mechanisms. This task ensures all error paths provide helpful feedback to users.

### Error Handling Architecture

The application has multiple layers of error handling:

1. **API Error Handler** (`handleApiError` function):
   - Extracts error messages from various response formats
   - Provides fallback messages
   - Logs errors for debugging

2. **Toast Notifications** (via `useUIStore`):
   - Success, error, warning, info variants
   - Auto-dismiss with configurable duration
   - Click to dismiss functionality

3. **Component-Level Error States**:
   - Loading states with spinners
   - Error states with retry buttons
   - Empty states with helpful messages

4. **Error Boundaries**:
   - Catch React component errors
   - Prevent full app crashes
   - Provide recovery options

### Detailed Test Cases

#### 1. Network Error Handling

**Setup:**
```bash
# Use browser DevTools to simulate network conditions
# Chrome: DevTools > Network > Offline
```

**Test Cases:**

a) **Collection Loading Failure:**
- Go offline
- Navigate to Collections dashboard
- **Expected:** "Failed to load collections" with Retry button
- Click Retry while still offline
- **Expected:** Error persists, toast shows "Network error"
- Go online and click Retry
- **Expected:** Collections load successfully

b) **Operation Submission Failure:**
- Start creating a collection
- Go offline before submitting
- Click Create
- **Expected:** Toast notification: "Network error: Unable to create collection"
- Modal remains open with form data intact
- Go online and retry
- **Expected:** Collection creates successfully

#### 2. API Validation Errors

**Test Cases:**

a) **Duplicate Collection Name:**
```javascript
// Try to create two collections with same name
// Backend should reject duplicate
```
- Create collection named "Test Collection"
- Try to create another with same name
- **Expected:** Toast: "Collection with this name already exists"
- Form remains open with error highlighted

b) **Invalid Path:**
- Try to add source with path: `/nonexistent/path`
- **Expected:** Clear error: "Path does not exist or is not accessible"

c) **Exceeding Limits:**
- If backend has limits (e.g., max collections per user)
- Try to exceed the limit
- **Expected:** Specific error: "Collection limit reached (10 max)"

#### 3. Permission Errors

**Test Cases:**

a) **Unauthorized Access:**
- Use DevTools to delete auth token from localStorage
- Try any operation
- **Expected:** Redirect to login page
- No infinite redirect loops

b) **Accessing Another User's Collection:**
- If you have a collection UUID from another user
- Try to access it directly via URL
- **Expected:** "Collection not found" or "Access denied"
- Redirect to collections list

#### 4. WebSocket Error Handling

**Test Cases:**

a) **WebSocket Connection Failure:**
```javascript
// Block WebSocket connections in browser
// Chrome: DevTools > Network > WS > Block
```
- Start an operation
- **Expected:** Falls back to polling
- Progress still updates (less real-time)
- Warning toast: "Real-time updates unavailable"

b) **WebSocket Message Parsing Error:**
- If malformed message received
- **Expected:** Error logged to console
- UI continues to function
- No crashes or infinite loops

#### 5. Component Error Boundaries

**Test Cases:**

a) **Render Error in Collection Card:**
```javascript
// Temporarily modify code to throw error in render
// Or use React DevTools to trigger error
```
- **Expected:** Error boundary catches it
- Other collection cards still render
- Error message: "Something went wrong displaying this collection"
- "Reload" button to retry

### Error Message Guidelines

Verify all errors follow these patterns:

1. **User-Friendly Language:**
   - ❌ "ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8080"
   - ✅ "Unable to connect to server. Please check your connection."

2. **Actionable:**
   - ❌ "Error occurred"
   - ✅ "Failed to create collection. Please try again or contact support."

3. **Specific When Possible:**
   - ❌ "Invalid input"
   - ✅ "Collection name must be between 3-50 characters"

### Console Error Monitoring

Check browser console for:
- No unhandled promise rejections
- No React key warnings in lists
- No infinite re-render loops
- Proper error logging with stack traces

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All network errors show user-friendly messages
- [ ] Retry functionality works for recoverable errors
- [ ] Form validation errors are clearly displayed
- [ ] No errors cause full page crashes
- [ ] WebSocket errors fall back gracefully
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and display component errors
- [ ] Console shows no unhandled errors
- [ ] Toast notifications appear for async errors
- [ ] Loading states prevent duplicate submissions
