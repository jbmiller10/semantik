# Collection-Centric Refactor Review - Ticket Summary

This document summarizes all tickets created from the end-to-end validation review of the collection-centric refactor.

## Critical Blockers (Must Fix Before Phase 6)

### TICKET-001: Fix PostgreSQL Migration Compatibility
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Issue:** Migration files fail on PostgreSQL due to missing ENUM type creation
- **Impact:** Application cannot start with PostgreSQL
- **File:** `ticket_001_postgresql_migration_compatibility.md`

### TICKET-002: Fix SQLAlchemy Async Engine Initialization Error  
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Issue:** TypeError on engine creation due to duplicate 'echo' parameter
- **Impact:** Application cannot start with PostgreSQL
- **File:** `ticket_002_sqlalchemy_async_engine_initialization.md`

## High Priority Issues

### TICKET-003: Complete Job-to-Collection Refactor
- **Priority:** High
- **Issue:** Old job-centric files still exist alongside new collection architecture
- **Impact:** Mixed paradigm, confusing codebase, potential bugs
- **File:** `ticket_003_complete_job_to_collection_refactor.md`

### TICKET-004: PostgreSQL Deployment Testing and Documentation
- **Priority:** High  
- **Issue:** PostgreSQL deployment path is untested and undocumented
- **Impact:** Cannot deploy with PostgreSQL in production
- **File:** `ticket_004_postgresql_deployment_testing.md`

### TICKET-005: Add Database Compatibility Testing
- **Priority:** High
- **Issue:** No automated tests to ensure both SQLite and PostgreSQL work
- **Impact:** Database-specific bugs go undetected
- **File:** `ticket_005_database_compatibility_testing.md`

## Execution Order

1. **First:** Fix TICKET-001 and TICKET-002 (critical blockers)
2. **Second:** Complete TICKET-003 (clean up codebase)
3. **Third:** Implement TICKET-005 (add compatibility tests)
4. **Fourth:** Complete TICKET-004 (deployment and documentation)

## Review Summary

The collection-centric refactor has been partially implemented but is not ready for Phase 6 (final testing and polish). Critical infrastructure issues prevent the application from running with PostgreSQL, and the refactor itself is incomplete with old code still present.

**Recommendation:** Address all critical and high priority tickets before proceeding to Phase 6.

## Additional Notes

- All tickets include detailed implementation steps
- Each ticket has clear acceptance criteria
- Docker build caching issues were noted - use `--no-cache` when testing fixes
- Consider adding a pre-Phase 6 validation step after these fixes
