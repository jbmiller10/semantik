### TICKET-SEC-001: Fix XSS Vulnerability in Chunking Metadata Sanitization

**Type**: Security Fix  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Branch**: `feature/improve-chunking`

#### Context
The chunking feature currently has insufficient HTML escaping in metadata sanitization, creating an XSS vulnerability. The basic escaping only covers `<` and `>` characters, missing other XSS vectors like quotes, ampersands, and JavaScript event handlers.

#### Current Implementation Location
- `/packages/webui/services/chunking_validation.py:271-273`
- `/packages/shared/chunks/metadata_sanitizer.py` (if exists)
- `/packages/webui/api/v2/chunking.py` (response formatting)

#### Requirements
1. Replace all instances of basic HTML escaping with comprehensive escaping
2. Use Python's `html.escape()` with `quote=True` parameter
3. Add validation for JavaScript event handlers in metadata
4. Implement Content Security Policy headers for chunking endpoints
5. Add unit tests for all XSS attack vectors
6. Ensure no regression in existing functionality

#### Implementation Steps
1. Search for all HTML escaping implementations in chunking-related files
2. Replace basic escaping with `html.escape(value, quote=True)`
3. Create a centralized sanitization utility if it doesn't exist
4. Add comprehensive XSS test cases
5. Update all API responses to use sanitized values
6. Add CSP headers to chunking API endpoints

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All user-provided metadata is properly escaped using `html.escape()`
- [ ] XSS test suite passes with 100% coverage of attack vectors
- [ ] No JavaScript can be executed from metadata fields
- [ ] CSP headers are present on all chunking endpoints
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] No visual regression in UI display of metadata

#### Test Cases to Add
```python
# tests/security/test_xss_prevention.py
xss_vectors = [
    '<script>alert("XSS")</script>',
    '"><script>alert("XSS")</script>',
    '<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS")>',
    'javascript:alert("XSS")',
    '<svg onload=alert("XSS")>',
    '&lt;script&gt;alert("XSS")&lt;/script&gt;',
    '<iframe src="javascript:alert(\'XSS\')">',
    '<body onload=alert("XSS")>',
]
```

#### Final Steps
1. Run `poetry run ruff check --fix packages/`
2. Run `poetry run ruff format packages/`
3. Run `poetry run pytest tests/security/`

### TICKET-SEC-002: Implement ReDoS Protection for Chunking Validation

**Type**: Security Fix  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Branch**: `feature/improve-chunking`

#### Context
Complex regex patterns in chunking validation can cause Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) through exponential backtracking. Current patterns have nested quantifiers and no timeout protection.

#### Current Implementation Location
- `/packages/webui/services/chunking_validation.py:39-45`
- `/packages/webui/services/input_validator.py:75-84`
- Any other files using regex for chunking validation

#### Requirements
1. Replace standard `re` module with `regex` module that supports timeouts
2. Simplify complex patterns to avoid nested quantifiers
3. Add timeout protection (1 second max) for all regex operations
4. Implement pattern complexity analysis before execution
5. Add fallback to simpler validation if timeout occurs
6. Create comprehensive test suite for ReDoS prevention

#### Implementation Steps
1. Install `regex` package: Add to `pyproject.toml`
2. Create `regex_safety.py` utility module
3. Replace all `re.search/match/findall` with timeout-protected versions
4. Simplify SQL injection and command injection patterns
5. Add pattern complexity checker
6. Implement comprehensive ReDoS test suite

#### Code Template
```python
# packages/shared/utils/regex_safety.py
import regex
import time
from typing import Optional, Pattern
from functools import wraps

class RegexTimeout(Exception):
    """Raised when regex operation times out."""
    pass

def safe_regex_search(
    pattern: str, 
    text: str, 
    timeout: float = 1.0,
    flags: int = 0
) -> Optional[regex.Match]:
    """Execute regex search with timeout protection."""
    try:
        compiled = regex.compile(pattern, flags)
        return compiled.search(text, timeout=timeout)
    except regex.TimeoutError:
        raise RegexTimeout(f"Pattern timed out after {timeout}s: {pattern[:50]}...")
    except Exception as e:
        # Log and handle other regex errors
        return None

def analyze_pattern_complexity(pattern: str) -> bool:
    """Check if pattern might cause ReDoS."""
    dangerous_patterns = [
        r'(\w+)*',  # Nested quantifiers
        r'(a+)+',   # Exponential backtracking
        r'([^"]*)*', # Catastrophic backtracking
    ]
    # Implementation here
    return True  # Safe by default
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All regex operations have timeout protection (1 second max)
- [ ] No nested quantifiers in validation patterns
- [ ] ReDoS test suite with pathological inputs passes
- [ ] Pattern complexity analysis prevents dangerous patterns
- [ ] Graceful fallback when timeout occurs
- [ ] Performance impact < 5% for normal inputs

#### Final Steps
1. Run `poetry run ruff check --fix packages/`
2. Run `poetry run ruff format packages/`
3. Run `poetry run pytest tests/security/test_redos_prevention.py`
4. Run performance benchmarks to verify < 5% impact
5. Commit with message: "fix(security): add ReDoS protection with regex timeouts"
6. Push to branch and create PR against `feature/improve-chunking`

### TICKET-SEC-003: Implement Audit Logging for Chunking Configuration Changes

**Type**: Security Enhancement  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Branch**: `feature/improve-chunking`

#### Context
Chunking strategy configuration changes are not currently logged to an audit trail, making it impossible to track who changed configurations and when. This is a compliance requirement for enterprise deployments.

#### Current Implementation Location
- `/packages/webui/api/v2/chunking.py:620-702` (update endpoints)
- `/packages/webui/services/chunking_service.py` (configuration updates)
- Need to create: `/packages/shared/services/audit_service.py`

#### Requirements
1. Create comprehensive audit logging service
2. Log all chunking configuration changes with full context
3. Include user, timestamp, old values, new values
4. Store audit logs in database with retention policy
5. Make audit logs immutable and tamper-evident
6. Add audit log query API for compliance reporting

#### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    user_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    resource_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    resource_id UUID NOT NULL,
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT,
    old_values JSONB,
    new_values JSONB,
    correlation_id UUID,
    metadata JSONB,
    checksum VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL -- SHA-256 of record for tamper detection
);

CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_user_id ON audit_logs(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_resource ON audit_logs(resource_type, resource_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_timestamp ON audit_logs(timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_logs_action ON audit_logs(action);
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create Alembic migration for audit_logs table
2. Create `AuditService` with async methods
3. Integrate audit logging into all chunking configuration endpoints
4. Add audit log query endpoints with filtering
5. Implement log retention policy (configurable)
6. Add comprehensive test coverage

#### Code Template
```python
# packages/shared/services/audit_service.py
import hashlib
import json
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any
from uuid import UUID
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession

class AuditService:
    def __init__(self, db: AsyncSession):
        self.db = db
    
    async def log_configuration_change(
        self,
        user_id: UUID,
        user_email: str,
        action: str,
        resource_type: str,
        resource_id: UUID,
        old_values: Optional[Dict[str, Any]],
        new_values: Dict[str, Any],
        request_context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    ) -> UUID:
        """Log a configuration change to audit trail."""
        audit_entry = {
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "user_id": str(user_id),
            "user_email": user_email,
            "action": action,
            "resource_type": resource_type,
            "resource_id": str(resource_id),
            "old_values": old_values,
            "new_values": new_values,
            "ip_address": request_context.get("ip_address") if request_context else None,
            "user_agent": request_context.get("user_agent") if request_context else None,
            "correlation_id": request_context.get("correlation_id") if request_context else None,
        }
        
        # Calculate checksum for tamper detection
        checksum = hashlib.sha256(
            json.dumps(audit_entry, sort_keys=True).encode()
        ).hexdigest()
        
        # Store in database
        # Implementation here
        
        return audit_id
```

#### Acceptance Criteria

### TICKET-ARCH-001: Refactor Business Logic from API Routers to Service Layer

**Type**: Architecture Refactoring  
**Priority**: High  
**Branch**: `feature/improve-chunking`

#### Context
API routers currently contain business logic that belongs in the service layer, violating separation of concerns. This includes data transformation, validation logic, and direct manipulation of response objects.

#### Current Violations Location
- `/packages/webui/api/v2/chunking.py:275-315` (chunk transformation in router)
- `/packages/webui/api/v2/chunking.py:400-450` (strategy mapping in router)
- Any other routers with business logic

#### Requirements
1. Move ALL business logic from routers to service layer
2. Routers should only handle HTTP concerns (request/response)
3. Create clear DTOs for service layer communication
4. Maintain backward compatibility for API responses
5. Improve testability by separating concerns
6. Document the architectural pattern

#### Refactoring Pattern
```python
# BEFORE (Bad - Business logic in router)
@router.post("/preview")
async def generate_preview(request: PreviewRequest):
    # Business logic in router - BAD
    chunks = []
    for chunk in result.get("chunks", []):
        content = chunk.get("content") or chunk.get("text", "")
        char_count = len(content)
        token_count = chunk.get("token_count", char_count // 4)
        chunks.append(ChunkPreview(...))
    return {"chunks": chunks}

# AFTER (Good - Logic in service)
@router.post("/preview")
async def generate_preview(
    request: PreviewRequest,
    service: ChunkingService = Depends(get_chunking_service)
):
    # Router only handles HTTP concerns
    preview = await service.generate_preview(request)
    return PreviewResponse.from_domain(preview)
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. Identify all business logic in chunking routers
2. Create service methods for each piece of business logic
3. Create DTOs for service <-> router communication
4. Update routers to delegate to service
5. Update tests to test service logic separately
6. Document the pattern in ARCHITECTURE.md

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No business logic remains in API routers
- [ ] All transformations happen in service layer
- [ ] Clear DTOs define service interfaces
- [ ] 100% backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Service methods have unit tests
- [ ] Architecture documentation updated

#### Final Steps
1. Run `poetry run ruff check --fix packages/`
2. Run `poetry run ruff format packages/`
3. Run `poetry run pytest tests/webui/`
4. Verify API responses unchanged with integration tests
5. Commit with message: "refactor(architecture): move business logic from routers to services"
6. Push to branch and create PR against `feature/improve-chunking`

### TICKET-ARCH-002: Split Monolithic ChunkingService into Focused Components

**Type**: Architecture Refactoring  
**Priority**: High  
**Branch**: `feature/improve-chunking`

#### Context
`ChunkingService` is over 1000 lines and violates Single Responsibility Principle. It handles caching, validation, processing, metrics, error handling, and more. This needs to be split into focused, composable services.

#### Current Implementation
- `/packages/webui/services/chunking_service.py` (1000+ lines)

#### Target Architecture
```
ChunkingOrchestrator (coordinates operations)
â”œâ”€â”€ ChunkingProcessor (core chunking logic)
â”œâ”€â”€ ChunkingCache (caching operations)
â”œâ”€â”€ ChunkingMetrics (metrics collection)
â”œâ”€â”€ ChunkingValidator (validation logic)
â””â”€â”€ ChunkingConfigManager (configuration management)
```

#### Requirements
1. Split ChunkingService into 5-6 focused services
2. Each service should have a single, clear responsibility
3. Use dependency injection for service composition
4. Maintain all existing functionality
5. Improve testability with isolated services
6. Document service responsibilities

#### Implementation Template
```python
# packages/webui/services/chunking/orchestrator.py
class ChunkingOrchestrator:
    """Orchestrates chunking operations across services."""
    
    def __init__(
        self,
        processor: ChunkingProcessor,
        cache: ChunkingCache,
        metrics: ChunkingMetrics,
        validator: ChunkingValidator,
        config_manager: ChunkingConfigManager
    ):
        self.processor = processor
        self.cache = cache
        self.metrics = metrics
        self.validator = validator
        self.config_manager = config_manager
    
    async def process_collection(
        self,
        collection_id: UUID,
        strategy: ChunkingStrategy,
        config: Dict[str, Any]
    ) -> ChunkingResult:
        """Orchestrate a complete chunking operation."""
        # Validate
        await self.validator.validate_config(strategy, config)
        
        # Check cache
        cached = await self.cache.get_cached_result(collection_id, strategy, config)
        if cached:
            self.metrics.record_cache_hit()
            return cached
        
        # Process
        with self.metrics.measure_operation():
            result = await self.processor.process(collection_id, strategy, config)
        
        # Cache result
        await self.cache.store_result(result)
        
        return result
```

#### Migration Steps
1. Create new service classes with clear interfaces
2. Move methods from ChunkingService to appropriate services
3. Create ChunkingOrchestrator to coordinate services
4. Update dependency injection configuration
5. Update all references to use new services
6. Remove old monolithic ChunkingService
7. Update tests for each service independently

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ChunkingService split into 5-6 focused services
- [ ] Each service < 200 lines of code
- [ ] Each service has single responsibility
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Each service has dedicated unit tests
- [ ] Service architecture documented
- [ ] No circular dependencies between services

### TICKET-ARCH-003: Consolidate Duplicate Chunking Implementations

**Type**: Architecture Refactoring  
**Priority**: High  
**Branch**: `feature/improve-chunking`

#### Context
There are two parallel chunking implementations: domain-based (`packages/shared/chunking/domain/`) and LlamaIndex-based (`packages/shared/text_processing/strategies/`). This duplication violates DRY and creates maintenance burden.

#### Current Duplicate Implementations
- `/packages/shared/chunking/domain/services/chunking_strategies/`
- `/packages/shared/text_processing/strategies/`

#### Requirements
1. Consolidate into single implementation per strategy
2. Keep domain-level abstractions
3. Use LlamaIndex where it provides value
4. Maintain all existing functionality
5. Single source of truth for each strategy
6. Clear adapter pattern if multiple implementations needed

#### Consolidation Strategy
```python
# packages/shared/chunking/unified/base.py
class UnifiedChunkingStrategy(ABC):
    """Single abstract base for all strategies."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def chunk(self, text: str, config: ChunkConfig) -> List[Chunk]:
        """Core chunking method."""
        pass
    
    def use_llama_index(self) -> bool:
        """Override to use LlamaIndex implementation."""
        return False

# packages/shared/chunking/unified/character_strategy.py
class CharacterChunkingStrategy(UnifiedChunkingStrategy):
    """Unified character-based chunking."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.domain_impl = DomainCharacterChunker()
        self.llama_impl = LlamaIndexCharacterChunker() if self.use_llama_index() else None
    
    async def chunk(self, text: str, config: ChunkConfig) -> List[Chunk]:
        if self.llama_impl and config.prefer_llama_index:
            return await self.llama_impl.chunk(text, config)
        return await self.domain_impl.chunk(text, config)
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create unified strategy interface
2. Merge duplicate implementations for each strategy
3. Create adapters where both implementations provide value
4. Update all imports to use unified strategies
5. Remove duplicate code
6. Update tests to cover unified implementation

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Single implementation per chunking strategy
- [ ] No duplicate code between implementations
- [ ] All tests pass with unified implementation
- [ ] Clear adapter pattern where needed
- [ ] Performance unchanged or improved
- [ ] Code reduction of at least 30%

#### Final Steps
1. Run `poetry run ruff check --fix packages/`
2. Run `poetry run ruff format packages/`
3. Run `poetry run pytest tests/`
4. Run performance benchmarks
5. Commit with message: "refactor(architecture): consolidate duplicate chunking implementations"
6. Push to branch and create PR against `feature/improve-chunking`

### TICKET-ARCH-004: Add Authorization Checks for Collection Access

**Type**: Security/Architecture Fix  
**Priority**: High  
**Branch**: `feature/improve-chunking`

#### Context
Not all chunking endpoints verify that the authenticated user has access to the collection they're modifying. This creates a security vulnerability where users could potentially modify collections they don't own.

#### Current Missing Checks
- `/packages/webui/api/v2/chunking.py` - various endpoints
- Missing `get_collection_for_user` dependency usage

#### Requirements
1. Add authorization checks to ALL mutation endpoints
2. Verify user owns or has access to collection
3. Use consistent authorization pattern
4. Return 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access
5. Add comprehensive authorization tests
6. Document authorization pattern

#### Authorization Pattern
```python
# packages/webui/api/dependencies/auth.py
async def verify_collection_access(
    collection_id: UUID,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
) -> Collection:
    """Verify user has access to collection."""
    collection = await collection_repository.get_by_id(db, collection_id)
    
    if not collection:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Collection not found")
    
    if collection.user_id != current_user.id:
        # Check for shared access if implemented
        has_access = await check_shared_access(db, current_user.id, collection_id)
        if not has_access:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied")
    
    return collection

# Usage in router
@router.post("/{collection_id}/reindex")
async def reindex_collection(
    collection_id: UUID,
    request: ReindexRequest,
    collection: Collection = Depends(verify_collection_access),  # Auth check
    service: ChunkingService = Depends(get_chunking_service)
):
    return await service.reindex(collection, request)
```

#### Implementation Steps
1. Create `verify_collection_access` dependency
2. Add to all collection mutation endpoints
3. Create `verify_document_access` for document operations
4. Update error responses to use consistent format
5. Add authorization tests for each endpoint
6. Document authorization pattern

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All mutation endpoints have authorization checks
- [ ] 403 returned for unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] 404 returned when collection doesn't exist
- [ ] Authorization tests cover all endpoints
- [ ] No regression in authorized access
- [ ] Pattern documented in API documentation

#### Final Steps
1. Run `poetry run ruff check --fix packages/`
2. Run `poetry run ruff format packages/`
3. Run `poetry run pytest tests/webui/test_authorization.py`
4. Test manually with different user accounts
5. Commit with message: "fix(security): add authorization checks for all collection operations"
6. Push to branch and create PR against `feature/improve-chunking`

### REVIEW-ARCH-004: Review Authorization Implementation for Collection Access

**Type**: Code Review  
**Priority**: High  
**Prerequisites**: TICKET-ARCH-004 completed

#### Context
Review the implementation of authorization checks for collection access across all chunking endpoints. Ensure proper security without impacting legitimate access.

#### Review Checklist

**Authorization Coverage:**
- [ ] ALL mutation endpoints have authorization checks
- [ ] Query endpoints have appropriate access controls
- [ ] Document-level access checks where needed
- [ ] No endpoints missing authorization

**Implementation Quality:**

- [ ] `verify_document_access` dependency correctly implemented
- [ ] Consistent authorization pattern across all endpoints
- [ ] Proper use of FastAPI dependencies

**Security Verification:**
- [ ] Returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access
- [ ] Returns 404 Not Found when resource doesn't exist (no information leakage)
- [ ] No way to bypass authorization checks
- [ ] Timing attacks not possible (constant-time checks)

**Error Handling:**
- [ ] Consistent error response format
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes used
- [ ] Correlation IDs in error responses

**Testing:**
- [ ] Authorization tests for every protected endpoint
- [ ] Tests verify both positive and negative cases
- [ ] Tests check different user roles/permissions
- [ ] Edge cases covered (deleted collections, shared access, etc.)

**Performance Impact:**
- [ ] No significant latency added to requests
- [ ] Database queries optimized (no N+1 queries)
- [ ] Caching used appropriately for permission checks
- [ ] No unnecessary database calls

**Documentation:**
- [ ] Authorization pattern documented in API docs
- [ ] OpenAPI schema updated with security requirements
- [ ] Error responses documented
- [ ] Migration guide for API consumers if needed
