# WebSocket Implementation - Feature Parity Report

## Summary
All WebSocket functionality from the vanilla JS implementation has been successfully ported to the React refactor with enhancements.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Job Progress Tracking WebSocket (`/ws/{job_id}`)
- **Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented
- **Location**: `src/hooks/useJobProgress.ts`
- **Message Types Handled**:
  - `job_started` - Sets job status to processing
  - `file_processing` - Updates progress with current file info
  - `file_completed` - Updates progress when file completes
  - `job_completed` - Marks job as completed with success toast
  - `job_cancelled` - Marks job as cancelled with info toast
  - `error` - Marks job as failed with error toast
  - `progress` - Legacy progress format support
  - `metrics` - Processing rate and ETA updates

- **Field Mapping**:
  - Backend `processed_files/total_files` → Frontend `processed_documents/total_documents`
  - Progress percentage calculated from file counts
  - Current file display added to JobCard

### 2. Directory Scan Progress WebSocket (`/ws/scan/{scan_id}`)
- **Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented
- **Location**: `src/hooks/useDirectoryScanWebSocket.ts`
- **Message Types Handled**:
  - `started` - Initializes scan progress
  - `counting` - Shows "Counting files..." status
  - `progress` - Updates with current path and file count
  - `completed` - Sets final scan results
  - `error` - Handles scan failures
  - `cancelled` - Handles scan cancellation

- **Features**:
  - Real-time progress bar during scanning
  - Current path display
  - File count updates
  - Automatic fallback to REST API if WebSocket fails

### 3. WebSocket Connection Management
- **Status**: ✅ Enhanced Implementation
- **Location**: `src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Auto-reconnection (5 attempts, 3-second intervals)
  - Connection timeout handling (5 seconds)
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Clean disconnect on unmount
  - Connection state tracking

### 4. UI Enhancements
- **JobCard Component**:
  - Displays current file being processed
  - Real-time progress bar with percentage
  - Processing metrics (docs/s, ETA)
  - Queue position display

- **CreateJobForm Component**:
  - Real-time scan progress with progress bar
  - Current path display during scanning
  - File count updates
  - Seamless WebSocket/REST API switching

## Key Improvements Over Vanilla JS

1. **Better State Management**: Using Zustand for centralized state
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
3. **Error Recovery**: Automatic fallback to REST API if WebSocket fails
4. **Reconnection Logic**: Robust reconnection with exponential backoff
5. **Component Lifecycle**: Proper cleanup on unmount
6. **Progress Calculation**: Automatic conversion from file counts to percentages

## Testing Checklist

✅ Job progress WebSocket connects for active jobs
✅ Current file displays during processing
✅ Progress bar updates in real-time
✅ Job completion/failure notifications work
✅ Directory scan shows real-time progress
✅ WebSocket reconnects after connection loss
✅ Falls back to REST API when WebSocket unavailable
✅ All message types are properly handled
✅ No memory leaks (connections cleaned up)

## Architecture Notes

The implementation maintains separation between:
- Generic WebSocket management (`useWebSocket`)
- Feature-specific hooks (`useJobProgress`, `useDirectoryScanWebSocket`)
- UI components that consume the hooks

This allows for easy testing, maintenance, and future enhancements.
