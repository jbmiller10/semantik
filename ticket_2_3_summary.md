# Ticket 2.3 Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### docker-compose.yml

1. **webui service** (lines 179-269):
   - ✓ Removed GPU device configuration (`devices` section with nvidia driver)
   - ✓ Removed GPU-related environment variables:
     - CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
     - MODEL_MAX_MEMORY_GB
     - MONITOR_GPU_MEMORY

2. **worker service** (lines 271-358):
   - ✓ Removed GPU device configuration (`devices` section with nvidia driver)
   - ✓ Removed GPU-related environment variables:
     - CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
     - MODEL_MAX_MEMORY_GB
     - MONITOR_GPU_MEMORY

3. **vecpipe service** (lines 106-177):
   - ✓ No changes - all GPU configuration remains intact

### docker-compose.cuda.yml

1. **webui service section**:
   - ✓ Completely removed the webui service definition
   - This included removal of all GPU-related environment variables:
     - LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     - CUDA_HOME
     - BITSANDBYTES_NOWELCOME
     - CC
     - CXX

2. **vecpipe service**:
   - ✓ No changes - all GPU configuration remains intact

## Verification Results

### GPU Configuration Check
Running grep for GPU-related configurations in docker-compose.yml shows:
- Line 128: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=${CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES:-0}` (in vecpipe only)
- Line 168: `driver: nvidia` (in vecpipe only)

### Service Check in docker-compose.cuda.yml
Only the `vecpipe` service remains defined - the `webui` service has been completely removed.

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✓ The `webui` service in docker-compose.yml has no GPU-related configuration
✓ The `worker` service in docker-compose.yml has no GPU-related configuration
✓ The `vecpipe` service is the only service with GPU access defined in docker-compose.yml
✓ GPU isolation is enforced at the infrastructure level

## Impact

- Only `vecpipe` can access GPU resources, preventing resource contention
- `webui` and `worker` services will have reduced resource footprint
- Aligns with the new architecture where all GPU operations are centralized in vecpipe
- Commands like `docker compose exec webui nvidia-smi` will fail
- Commands like `docker compose exec vecpipe nvidia-smi` will succeed
