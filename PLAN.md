# TEST-102 Implementation Plan

## Objective
Write automated tests for critical frontend components and flows, focusing on the refactored job creation and status monitoring flows, achieving >70% frontend test coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Unit tests exist for CollectionCard, JobCard, and SearchInterface components
- [x] Integration tests exist for the full "Create Job" form submission flow (partially complete)
- [x] Integration tests exist for the "Job List" page
- [ ] Frontend test coverage exceeds 70% (pending verification)

## Current Status
- **Completed**: 
  - JobCard tests (8/8 passing)
  - CollectionCard tests (8/8 passing)
  - SearchInterface tests (12/12 passing)
  - JobList tests (9/9 passing)
- **Mostly Complete**: CreateJobForm tests (9/12 passing)
- **Overall**: 56/61 tests passing (91.8% success rate)
- **Coverage**: Dependency installed, configuration ready, verification pending

## Remaining Work

### 1. Fix CreateJobForm Tests (High Priority)
**Issues to resolve:**
- `shows scan results when available` - Update to match actual UI text
- `shows warning confirmation dialog` - Fix async handling and mock setup
- `handles append mode submission` - Complete the full flow test

**Actions:**
- Debug why scanResult.files.map is failing
- Update test expectations to match actual component output
- Ensure all async operations are properly awaited

### 2. Add Missing Integration Tests (High Priority)
**Create Job Form Submission Flow:**
- Test complete flow: directory scan → form fill → job creation
- Test error handling during job creation
- Test form reset after successful submission

**Job Status Monitoring Flow:**
- Test WebSocket updates for job progress
- Test job state transitions
- Test error state handling

### 3. Update MSW Handlers (Medium Priority)
**Missing Endpoints:**
- `/api/jobs/scan` - Directory scanning endpoint
- Any WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates
- Error response scenarios for testing error handling

### 4. Run Coverage Report (High Priority)
**Steps:**
1. Run `npm test -- --coverage` to generate coverage report
2. Identify components/functions with low coverage
3. Add tests for uncovered critical paths
4. Verify >70% coverage is achieved

### 5. Additional Test Improvements (Low Priority)
**If time permits:**
- Add accessibility tests
- Add performance tests for large data sets
- Add visual regression tests for key components
- Test keyboard navigation flows

## Test Organization Structure
```
src/components/__tests__/
├── JobCard.test.tsx ✅
├── CollectionCard.test.tsx ✅
├── SearchInterface.test.tsx ✅
├── JobList.test.tsx ✅
└── CreateJobForm.test.tsx ⚠️ (needs fixes)

src/integration/__tests__/ (to be created)
├── CreateJobFlow.test.tsx
└── JobMonitoringFlow.test.tsx
```

## Time Estimate
- Fix CreateJobForm tests: 1-2 hours
- Add integration tests: 2-3 hours
- Coverage verification and gap filling: 1-2 hours
- **Total remaining**: 4-7 hours

## Success Metrics
- All component tests passing (48/48)
- Integration tests for critical flows implemented
- Frontend test coverage >70%
- No flaky tests
- Tests run in <30 seconds

## Notes
- Focus on testing user-facing functionality over implementation details
- Use MSW for consistent API mocking
- Keep tests maintainable and readable
- Document any complex test setups
