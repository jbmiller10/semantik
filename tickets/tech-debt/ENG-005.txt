Ticket: ENG-005 – Phase 1 Implementation Review & Hardening
Phase: 1 – Shared Utilities (Sprint 1) Review
Owner Type: Staff backend engineer or tech lead performing code reviews/QA sign-off

Purpose:
Ensure Phase 1 deliverables (ENG-001 through ENG-004) have been implemented correctly, integrated cleanly, and are ready for handoff to the Phase 2 team. This ticket focuses on verification, cross-cutting QA, documentation, and follow-up issue capture.

Scope to Review:
- `ProgressUpdateManager` integration across Celery tasks and WebSocket manager.
- `ErrorClassifier` centralization and adapters.
- Consolidated chunking strategy defaults/mappings.
- Shared chunking validation helpers and resulting refactors.

Review Checklist:
1. Code Quality & Consistency
   - Confirm duplicated logic in original files (`chunking_tasks.py`, `websocket_manager.py`, `chunking_service.py`, `chunking/config_manager.py`, `chunking_validation.py`, `chunking/validator.py`) has been removed or replaced by shared modules.
   - Verify new modules follow repository style guidelines (typing, docstrings, logging).
2. Behavioural Validation
   - Run `make test`, `make lint`, `make type-check` and confirm clean results.
   - Review unit tests added in Phase 1 to ensure coverage is meaningful (positive/negative cases, error handling, async pathways).
   - Execute targeted manual tests if feasible:
     * Trigger a chunking operation locally (via `make dev` stack) to observe Redis stream updates.
     * Confirm WebSocket UI still receives progress updates.
3. Backwards Compatibility
   - Ensure stream keys, payload schemas, and error codes are unchanged (compare to logs/fixtures pre-refactor if available).
   - Confirm API responses for strategy metadata and validation error messages remain identical (use existing regression tests or manual calls).
4. Documentation & DX
   - Check that module docs and READMEs reference new utilities.
   - Ensure developer onboarding notes (if any) mention the shared modules as source of truth.
5. Follow-up Work
   - Log new tickets for any gaps, TODOs, or edge cases uncovered during review.
   - Provide summary notes for Phase 2 engineers (e.g., "ProgressUpdateManager exposes X API"), ideally in project wiki or central doc.

Deliverables:
- Review findings documented in PR comments and a short summary posted to engineering channel or shared doc.
- List of follow-up tickets/issues (if needed) with owners.
- Confirmation that CI pipelines remain green after Phase 1 merges.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Review completed with explicit sign-off recorded (link to PR review or written approval).
- No unresolved high-severity regressions identified; any medium/low findings have tracked follow-up tickets.
- QA evidence attached (command outputs, screenshots of tests, manual verification notes).
- Handoff note prepared for Phase 2 team summarizing utilities they will rely on.

Out of Scope:
- Implementing additional refactors beyond Phase 1 scope (should be logged as new work).
