# Phase 3 Ticket: Documentation & Portfolio Playbook (Target Window: November 24 – December 12, 2025)

## Background
With backend refactors underway, Semantik needs polished documentation and demo scripts to impress reviewers. Existing docs (README, CLAUDE.md) are solid but lack an architecture overview reflecting Phase 0–2 changes and a succinct portfolio playbook. This ticket captures all documentation deliverables for Phase 3.

## Objectives
1. Produce an architecture guide describing Semantik’s components post-refactor.
2. Update README with a concise demo walkthrough and developer checklist.
3. Create a portfolio playbook detailing environment setup, validation commands, and storytelling tips.

## Requirements
### 1. Architecture Documentation
- Author `docs/architecture.md` (new file) covering:
  - High-level system diagram (ASCII acceptable) showing webui, vecpipe, workers, Postgres, Qdrant, Redis, external services.
  - Descriptions of major flows (ingestion, chunking, search) referencing new helper classes from the backend refactor.
  - Security controls introduced in Phase 0 (secret validation, admin-only endpoints).
  - Resource quota/sharing model from Phase 1.
- Include links to relevant source files and highlight extension points.

### 2. README Enhancements
- Add a "Demo Walkthrough" section explaining a 5-minute guided flow: create collection → upload documents → monitor operations → run hybrid search → review analytics.
- Update the "Development" section to reflect new CI requirements (`make format`, `make lint`, `make type-check`, `uv run safety check`).
- Link to the architecture doc and playbook.

### 3. Portfolio Playbook
- Create `docs/portfolio_playbook.md` with:
  - Steps to prepare an environment (secrets via wizard, Docker profile for testing DB).
  - Validation checklist (commands from prior phases, accessibility scan, screenshot capture tips).
  - Suggested talking points for interviews (collaboration features, security posture, testing rigor).
- Reference relevant tickets or documents where necessary.

### 4. Update Supporting Docs
- Touch `PORTFOLIO_CLEANUP_SPRINT.md` (if still in use) summarizing completion of Phases 0–3 and linking to the new playbook.
- If `docs/security.md` exists, ensure it references the new secret enforcement details.

## Acceptance Criteria
- New architecture doc exists with accurate diagrams/descriptions and links.
- README includes demo walkthrough and updated developer checklist.
- Portfolio playbook provides clear, step-by-step guidance for showcasing Semantik.
- Supporting docs cross-reference the new materials.
- All documentation passes markdown linting (if applicable) and feels cohesive.

## Validation Steps
1. Run markdown lint/formatting command if available (e.g., `npm run lint:md`).
2. Review docs in a Markdown viewer to ensure diagrams render properly.
3. Dry-run the demo walkthrough against a local stack to confirm instructions are accurate.
4. Share the playbook with a teammate for sanity check feedback.

## Coordination Notes
- Sync with backend refactor ticket owners to ensure terminology matches new components.
- Capture screenshots after frontend polish to embed or link in docs (if acceptable).
- Ensure references to CI expectations match Phase 2 outputs.

## Out of Scope
- Implementing new product features or refactors (handled elsewhere).
- Creating marketing website content beyond technical documentation.
- Recording full video demos (optional follow-up once documentation is stable).
- Broad translation/localization efforts.
