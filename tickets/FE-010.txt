Ticket: FE-010 – Phase 3 Frontend Review & UI Regression Pass
Phase: 3 – Frontend Modularization (Sprints 3–4) Review
Owner Type: Frontend tech lead or staff engineer with access to design/QA resources

Purpose:
Confirm that Phase 3 tickets (FE-001 through FE-003) delivered the intended modularization, shared component adoption, and maintained UX parity. This review ensures the refactored modals are production-ready and that documentation/tests adequately support future changes.

Scope to Review:
- Decomposed `CollectionDetailsModal` and `CreateCollectionModal` structures.
- Shared chunking UI/components/hooks.
- Updated tests (unit, component, optional e2e) covering modal workflows.

Review Checklist:
1. Code Structure & Readability
   - Inspect new hook/component directories (`src/hooks/`, `src/components/collection-details/`, `src/components/create-collection/`, `src/components/chunking/`) for organization, naming consistency, and minimal cross-coupling.
   - Ensure legacy monolithic modal files are reduced to orchestrators and do not reintroduce heavy logic.
2. Behaviour Verification
   - Run `npm install --prefix apps/webui-react` (if needed) followed by `npm test --prefix apps/webui-react` and lint/type commands (`npm run lint`, `npm run type-check` if configured).
   - Execute local UI smoke tests: start frontend via `make frontend-dev` against backend (phase 2 stack) and manually exercise both modals:
     * Open/close modals, switch tabs, trigger nested modals.
     * Create collection with/without initial source, observe toast notifications.
     * Verify strategy selectors and progress summaries use shared components.
   - If Playwright or Cypress suites exist, run targeted scenarios for these modals.
3. UX & Accessibility
   - Confirm visual diffs acceptable (use Storybook snapshots or Percy if available).
   - Check keyboard navigation and focus management within modals after refactor.
   - Ensure ARIA attributes and accessible labels preserved or improved.
4. Data Integrity & Contract Alignment
   - Ensure frontend relies on centralized chunking metadata introduced in ENG-003 (check API clients/constants).
   - Verify query cache keys, invalidation, and state resets remain correct (React Query behaviour).
5. Documentation & Hand-off
   - Review new Storybook stories or README entries explaining hook/component responsibilities.
   - Summarize changes for support/QA teams; highlight areas needing regression attention in future releases.
6. Follow-up Tracking
   - Record any polish items or minor defects discovered and create follow-up tickets with priority/severity.

Deliverables:
- Review summary including links to executed test runs, manual verification notes, and screenshot references if UI adjustments made.
- Confirmation that all relevant documentation (Storybook, docs site, internal wiki) updated.
- List of outstanding issues (if any) with owners.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Phase 3 work signed off with no critical UX or functional regressions.
- Automated test suites pass; manual QA evidence captured.
- Shared components documented and ready for reuse by future efforts.
- Ready-to-ship recommendation recorded or explicit blockers noted with mitigation plan.

Out of Scope:
- Driving additional feature work unrelated to refactor.
- Backend adjustments (covered in earlier phases).
