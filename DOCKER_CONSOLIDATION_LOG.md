# Docker Consolidation Development Log

## Ticket-001: Stabilize and Simplify the Docker Environment

### Overview
This log tracks the progress of consolidating the fragmented Docker setup into a single source of truth.

### Initial State
- 5 separate docker-compose files: `.yml`, `.dev.yml`, `.postgres.yml`, `.cuda.yml`, `.prod.yml`
- 2 separate Dockerfiles: `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.cuda`
- Configuration duplication and confusion
- PostgreSQL missing from main docker-compose.yml

### Target State
- Single `docker-compose.yml` as source of truth
- Single unified `Dockerfile` supporting both CPU and GPU
- Docker profiles for local development flexibility
- Clean, maintainable structure

---

## Progress Log

### Task 1: Analyze all docker-compose files ✅ [COMPLETED]
**Started:** 2025-07-22  
**Status:** Completed - analyzed all 5 docker-compose files

#### Analysis Summary:
1. **docker-compose.yml** (Main):
   - Services: qdrant, vecpipe, webui, redis, worker, flower
   - Issue: Missing PostgreSQL, worker uses Dockerfile.cuda
   - GPU support enabled by default

2. **docker-compose.dev.yml** (Development):
   - Services: All 7 services including PostgreSQL
   - Complete DATABASE_URL configurations
   - Proper health checks and dependencies
   - Most comprehensive configuration

3. **docker-compose.postgres.yml** (PostgreSQL overlay):
   - PostgreSQL service definition
   - Environment variable updates for webui, worker, vecpipe
   - Dependency configurations

4. **docker-compose.cuda.yml** (CUDA overlay):
   - Environment variables for bitsandbytes INT8 support
   - Overrides build context to use Dockerfile.cuda

5. **docker-compose.prod.yml** (Production overlay):
   - Production optimizations
   - Security settings
   - Nginx reverse proxy

**Decision:** Use docker-compose.dev.yml as the base for consolidation since it has the most complete service definitions.

### Task 2: Create consolidated docker-compose.yml ✅ [COMPLETED]
**Started:** 2025-07-22  
**Status:** Completed - created single docker-compose.yml with all services

#### Changes Made:
- Created new docker-compose.yml with all 7 services
- Based on docker-compose.dev.yml for completeness
- Fixed all Dockerfile references to use single Dockerfile (not Dockerfile.cuda)
- Included PostgreSQL with proper configuration
- All services have complete environment variables and dependencies

---

### Task 3: Implement Docker profiles ✅ [COMPLETED]
**Started:** 2025-07-22  
**Status:** Completed - implemented backend profile strategy

#### Profile Implementation:
- Added `profiles: ["backend"]` to: qdrant, postgres, redis, vecpipe, worker
- Left webui and flower without profiles (default services)
- `docker compose up` - starts all services (complete stack)
- `docker compose --profile backend up` - starts backend services only (for local dev)

---

### Task 4: Merge Dockerfiles ✅ [COMPLETED]
**Started:** 2025-07-22  
**Status:** Completed - created unified Dockerfile

#### Changes Made:
- Created single Dockerfile using nvidia/cuda:12.1.0-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04 as base
- Works for both CPU-only and GPU-enabled hosts
- Merged all system dependencies from both original files
- Includes CUDA libraries for bitsandbytes INT8 support
- Updated docker-compose.cuda.yml to remove Dockerfile override

#### Key Features:
- Multi-stage build maintained
- Python installed via deadsnakes PPA for Ubuntu
- All runtime dependencies included
- Proper CUDA environment setup
- Non-root user (appuser) for security

---

### Task 5: Update Makefile ✅ [COMPLETED]
**Started:** 2025-07-22  
**Status:** Completed - updated all Docker commands

#### Changes Made:
- Removed all references to docker-compose.postgres.yml and docker-compose.dev.yml
- Simplified docker commands to use single docker-compose.yml
- Updated docker-dev-up to use `docker compose --profile backend up -d`
- All PostgreSQL commands now use the single compose file

---

### Task 6: Update scripts ✅ [COMPLETED]
**Started:** 2025-07-22  
**Status:** Completed - updated dev-local.sh

#### Changes Made:
- Updated scripts/dev-local.sh to use `docker compose --profile backend up -d`
- Removed references to docker-compose.dev.yml
- Script now properly uses the backend profile for local development

---

### Task 7: Clean up old files ✅ [COMPLETED]
**Started:** 2025-07-22  
**Status:** Completed - deleted obsolete files

#### Files Deleted:
- docker-compose.dev.yml
- docker-compose.postgres.yml
- Dockerfile.cuda

#### Files Remaining:
- docker-compose.yml (main consolidated file)
- docker-compose.cuda.yml (overlay for INT8 quantization)
- docker-compose.prod.yml (overlay for production)
- Dockerfile (unified, supports both CPU and GPU)

---

### Task 8: Test all Docker commands ✅ [READY FOR TESTING]
**Started:** 2025-07-22  
**Status:** Ready for user testing

#### Commands to Test:

**Basic Operations:**
- `docker compose up -d` - Should start all 7 services
- `docker compose ps` - Should show all services running
- `docker compose down` - Should stop all services

**Profile Operations:**
- `docker compose --profile backend up -d` - Should start only 5 backend services (no webui/flower)
- `docker compose --profile backend ps` - Should show only backend services

**Makefile Commands:**
- `make docker-up` - Full stack deployment
- `make docker-down` - Stop all services
- `make docker-logs` - View logs
- `make docker-dev-up` - Backend services only
- `make dev-local` - Run backend in Docker + webui locally

**Build Testing:**
- `docker compose build` - Should build using unified Dockerfile
- Image should work on both CPU and GPU hosts

---

## Summary

### ✅ Completed Objectives:
1. **Consolidated Docker Configuration**
   - Single `docker-compose.yml` as source of truth
   - All 7 services properly defined with dependencies
   - PostgreSQL included with complete configuration

2. **Implemented Docker Profiles**
   - Default: All services run with `docker compose up`
   - Backend profile: Only backend services for local development
   - Clean separation for development workflows

3. **Unified Dockerfile**
   - Single Dockerfile using nvidia/cuda base
   - Works for both CPU-only and GPU-enabled hosts
   - Includes all necessary dependencies

4. **Updated Supporting Files**
   - Makefile simplified and updated
   - scripts/dev-local.sh uses backend profile
   - docker-compose.cuda.yml updated (no Dockerfile override)

5. **Cleaned Up Legacy Files**
   - Removed docker-compose.dev.yml
   - Removed docker-compose.postgres.yml
   - Removed Dockerfile.cuda

### Definition of Done ✓
- ✅ Single source of truth (docker-compose.yml)
- ✅ Profile functionality implemented
- ✅ Unified Docker image
- ✅ Clean file structure
- ✅ Documentation consistency
- ⏳ Functional tests (ready for user testing)

### Impact:
This consolidation eliminates configuration duplication, reduces confusion, and provides a stable foundation for the Semantik project. The Docker environment is now significantly simpler and more maintainable.
