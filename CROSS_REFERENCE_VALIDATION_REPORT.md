- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) → ❌ **MISSING** - Referenced but does not exist
- [LICENSE](LICENSE) → ❌ **MISSING** - Referenced but does not exist

### ❌ Broken or Incorrect Links

1. **README.md** references several documentation files that don't exist:
   - `docs/installation.md` (line 184)
   - `docs/api-reference.md` (line 368) - Should be `/API_REFERENCE.md`
   - `docs/deployment.md` (line 370)
   - `docs/performance.md` (line 371)
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md` (line 355)
   - `LICENSE` (line 383)

2. **Image References:**
   - README.md references `docs/images/vecpipe-dashboard.png` (line 11) → ❌ **MISSING**

## 2. Code Example Validation

### ✅ Correct Code Examples

**In README.md:**
- Docker Compose example (lines 136-171) correctly references services and ports
- Python SDK example (lines 211-234) correctly imports from `semantik` package
- REST API examples use correct endpoints and headers

**In API_REFERENCE.md:**
- All endpoint examples match the actual implementation in `search_api.py`
- Request/response formats are consistent with Pydantic models

### ❌ Issues Found

1. **Package Name Inconsistency:**
   - README.md Python SDK example imports from `semantik` (line 212)
   - But the actual package name in pyproject.toml is `document-embedding-system`
   - The packages are named `vecpipe` and `webui` in the codebase

2. **Port Inconsistencies:**
   - README.md states Search API runs on port 8001 (multiple references)
   - API_REFERENCE.md states Search API runs on port 8000 (line 9)
   - ARCH.md shows Search API on port 8001 (line 46)
   - WEBUI_BACKEND.md correctly shows both services on port 8000

3. **GitHub Repository URL:**
   - README.md references `https://github.com/yourusername/vecpipe.git` (line 40)
   - Should be updated to actual repository URL

## 3. Consistency Checks

### ✅ Consistent Elements

1. **Architecture Descriptions:**
   - The separation between VecPipe core and WebUI is consistently described
   - Microservices architecture is uniformly explained
   - Database architecture (SQLite + Qdrant) is consistent

2. **Feature Lists:**
   - GPU memory management features are consistently described
   - Quantization modes (float32, float16, int8) are uniform
   - Search types (semantic, hybrid, keyword) are consistent

### ❌ Terminology Inconsistencies

1. **Branding Confusion:**
   - Project is called "Semantik" in most places
   - Still references "VecPipe" in many documentation files
   - ARCH.md title says "Semantik" but content refers to "VecPipe"
   - VECPIPE_CORE.md title says "Semantik Core" but filename is VECPIPE_CORE

2. **Service Names:**
   - Sometimes called "Search API" vs "Semantik Core Engine"
   - "WebUI" vs "Control Plane" used interchangeably

3. **Model Names:**
   - Qwen3 vs Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding variations
   - Different capitalization of model names

   - Remove or create missing documentation links

3. **Standardize Branding:**
   - Complete the rebrand from VecPipe to Semantik
   - Update all file names and references consistently
   - Update GitHub URLs to actual repository

4. **Fix Port Documentation:**
   - Clarify that both WebUI and Search API run on different ports
   - Update all references to use consistent port numbers

5. **Update Code Examples:**
   - Fix Python package import statements
   - Add actual repository URL
   - Ensure all examples are tested and working

### Medium Priority Improvements

1. **Add Missing Images:**
   - Create or add the dashboard screenshot
   - Add architecture diagrams as image files

2. **Enhance API Documentation:**
   - Add complete request/response examples
   - Document all error codes and responses
   - Add authentication flow examples

3. **Version Documentation:**
   - Add version compatibility matrix
   - Document breaking changes between versions

### Low Priority Enhancements

1. **Add Performance Testing Guide:**
   - Document how benchmarks were obtained
   - Provide scripts for users to run their own benchmarks

2. **Expand Configuration Guide:**
   - Add troubleshooting section for common configuration issues
   - Provide example configurations for different use cases

## Conclusion

The documentation is comprehensive and well-structured but contains several inconsistencies and missing pieces that should be addressed. The highest priority is creating the missing installation and deployment guides, fixing broken links, and completing the VecPipe to Semantik rebranding. Once these issues are resolved, the documentation will provide an excellent resource for users and developers.
