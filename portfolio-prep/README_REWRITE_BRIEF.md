## 1. Project Overview

### What Semantik Is

**Semantik** is a self-hosted semantic search engine that transforms private file servers into AI-powered knowledge bases without data ever leaving the user's hardware.

**Core Value Proposition**: Privacy-first semantic search using AI embeddings to understand *meaning*, not just keywords.

**Primary Use Cases**:
1. **Research Paper Management** - Academic researchers with large document corpora
2. **Enterprise Knowledge Base** - Companies with internal documentation
3. **Personal Documentation** - Individuals organizing notes, articles, research
4. **Legal Document Search** - Law firms searching case files by concept
5. **Code Documentation** - Developers searching technical docs semantically

### Problem It Solves

**Traditional keyword search limitations**:
- Requires exact keyword matches
- Misses conceptually related documents with different terminology
- Example: Search "neural network optimization" → misses papers about "gradient descent convergence", "backpropagation efficiency", "deep learning training strategies"

**Semantik's solution**:
- AI embeddings understand semantic meaning
- Finds related documents regardless of terminology
- 100% local processing (privacy-first)
- No external API calls for embeddings or search

### Current Development Status

- **Phase**: Pre-release, active development
- **Core Features**: Production-ready (indexing, search, collection management)
- **Current Focus**: UI/UX refinement, security hardening
- **Active Branch**: `phase0-security-fixes`
- **Architecture Migration**: Transitioning from "job-centric" to "collection-centric" terminology (mostly complete)

## 2. Current README Analysis

### What the Current README Does Well

✅ **Clear structure** with logical sections
✅ **Comprehensive quick start** with wizard option
✅ **Docker-first approach** clearly documented
✅ **System requirements** well-specified (GPU vs CPU)
✅ **Troubleshooting section** with 4 common issues
✅ **Professional badges** (Python version, license, Docker)

### Critical Gaps in Current README

❌ **ZERO visual assets** - No screenshots, diagrams, or images
❌ **No problem/solution narrative** - Jumps straight to features without context
❌ **Weak value proposition** - Doesn't answer "why does this exist?"
❌ **Missing performance metrics** - No concrete speed/scale data
❌ **No demo instructions** - Can't quickly evaluate the product
❌ **Features lack substance** - Listed but not explained with examples
❌ **No competitive positioning** - Doesn't compare to alternatives
❌ **Incomplete roadmap** - No timeline or status indicators
❌ **Generic "pre-release" framing** - Suggests vaporware

### README Content to Preserve

**Keep these sections**:
- Badge row (Python, License, Docker, Code Style)
- Quick Start with wizard
- System Requirements table
- Docker Compose service overview
- Development workflow commands
- Testing instructions
- License information

**Enhance these sections**:
- Project description (add narrative)
- Features (add examples and depth)
- Architecture (add visual diagram reference)
- Performance (add concrete metrics)

**Add new sections**:
- "Why Semantik?" (problem/solution)
- Screenshots gallery
- Performance benchmarks
- Use cases
- Comparison to alternatives

```

#### Service Breakdown

**1. webui** (Main API Service - FastAPI)
- **Port**: 8080
- **Purpose**: User-facing API, authentication, collection management
- **Components**:
  - REST API (FastAPI) with 45 endpoints (22 GET, 12 POST, 4 DELETE, 1 PUT, 1 PATCH)
  - WebSocket server for real-time progress updates
  - React 19 frontend (served via Vite)
  - JWT authentication (24h access, 30d refresh tokens)
  - Rate limiting per endpoint

**2. vecpipe** (Embedding & Search Service - FastAPI)
- **Port**: 8000
- **Purpose**: Compute-intensive operations (embeddings, search)
- **Components**:
  - Document parsing (PDF, TXT, Markdown, code files)
  - GPU-accelerated embedding generation
  - Semantic search against Qdrant
  - Reranking with cross-encoder models
  - Quantized models for VRAM efficiency (<2GB)

**3. worker** (Background Task Processor - Celery)
- **Purpose**: Async background operations
- **Tasks**:
  - Collection indexing (initial and incremental)
  - Blue-green reindexing (zero downtime)
  - Document addition/removal
  - Collection deletion with cleanup

**4. Infrastructure Services**
- **PostgreSQL**: Metadata storage (collections, documents, operations, users)
  - 100 LIST partitions on chunks table (partition by collection_id)
- **Redis**: WebSocket pub/sub, Celery broker, caching
- **Qdrant**: Vector database for embeddings

### Three-Layer Architecture Pattern

**CRITICAL**: The codebase follows strict architectural layers:

```
API Layer (packages/webui/api/)
    ↓ (delegates to)
Service Layer (packages/webui/services/)
    ↓ (uses)
Repository Layer (packages/shared/database/repositories/)
    ↓ (accesses)
Database (PostgreSQL, Qdrant)
```

**API Layer**: FastAPI routers ONLY - no business logic, no direct DB calls
**Service Layer**: ALL business logic, transaction management, orchestration
**Repository Layer**: Database access ONLY, abstracts SQLAlchemy details

### Database Schema Highlights

**Partition Strategy** (Advanced):
- `chunks` table uses **100 LIST partitions** based on `collection_id`
- Partition-aware queries essential for performance (<200ms search)
- ALWAYS include `collection_id` in chunk queries for partition pruning

**Key Tables**:
- `users` - Authentication and authorization
- `collections` - Document collections with owner_id
- `documents` - Individual files within collections
- `chunks` - Text segments with embeddings (partitioned)
- `operations` - Async operation tracking (replaces legacy "jobs")

### WebSocket Architecture

**Scalability Design**:
- Redis pub/sub for horizontal scaling
- Connection limits: 10 per user, 10,000 total
- JWT authentication via first message after connection
- Channels: `operation-progress:{operation_id}`, `collection-updates:{collection_id}`

**Use Cases**:
- Real-time indexing progress
- Collection status updates
- Error notifications
- Background task completion

### Celery Task Pattern (Critical for Correctness)

**Transaction-Before-Dispatch** pattern prevents race conditions:

```python
# CORRECT sequence:
1. Create operation record in database
2. Commit transaction
3. THEN dispatch Celery task
4. Return operation ID to client

# WRONG (causes race condition):
# Dispatch task before commit → worker can't find operation
```

**Operation Types**:
- `INDEX` - Initial collection indexing
- `APPEND` - Add new documents
- `REINDEX` - Blue-green zero-downtime reindex
- `DELETE` - Collection deletion
- `REMOVE_SOURCE` - Remove documents by source path

### Chunking System (Domain-Driven Design)

**Modern chunking** (`packages/shared/chunking/`):
- Domain-driven architecture with 30+ files
- Factory pattern for strategy selection
- Configurable chunk size (100-10,000 chars) and overlap

**6 Chunking Strategies**:
1. **CHARACTER**: Simple fixed-size chunks (fastest)
2. **RECURSIVE**: Intelligent hierarchical splitting with overlap
3. **MARKDOWN**: Preserves document structure (headers, lists, code blocks)
4. **SEMANTIC**: AI-powered meaning-based boundaries
5. **HIERARCHICAL**: Document section-aware chunking
6. **HYBRID**: Combined approach for optimal results

**Legacy Note**: `packages/shared/text_processing/chunking.py` is deprecated but still present (technical debt)

## 6. Performance Metrics

### Indexing Performance

**Real-world benchmarks** (RTX 4060, 8GB VRAM):

| Document Count | Time | Document Type | Notes |
|----------------|------|---------------|-------|
| 1,000 docs | ~30 seconds | Markdown, avg 5KB | Cold start includes model loading |
| 10,000 docs | ~5 minutes | Mixed PDFs and text | Includes chunking + embedding |
| 100,000 docs | ~45 minutes | Research papers | Sustained throughput ~37 docs/sec |

**CPU-only mode** (i7-12700, 32GB RAM):
- 10,000 docs: ~25 minutes (slower by 5x)

**Factors affecting speed**:
- Document size and complexity
- Chunking strategy (Character fastest, Semantic slowest)
- GPU availability and VRAM
- Batch size (configurable: 8-64)

### Search Latency

**Query performance** (measured on collections with warm cache):

| Collection Size | Search Type | p50 Latency | p95 Latency | p99 Latency |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 10k documents | Semantic | <100ms | <150ms | <200ms |
| 100k documents | Semantic | <200ms | <300ms | <400ms |
| 100k documents | Hybrid (keyword + semantic) | <250ms | <400ms | <550ms |
| 100k documents | Hybrid + Reranking | <350ms | <500ms | <700ms |

**Performance factors**:
- Partition pruning (CRITICAL - queries without `collection_id` are 10x slower)
- Qdrant HNSW index efficiency
- Reranking overhead (~50-100ms)
- Network latency (vecpipe service call)

**Cold cache penalty**: First query +100-200ms for model loading

### Resource Usage

**Typical deployment**:

**webui service**:
- RAM: 4GB typical, 6GB peak
- CPU: 2 cores (4 threads recommended)
- Disk: <500MB code + logs

**vecpipe service**:
- RAM: 6-8GB during indexing, 4GB idle
- VRAM: 1.5-2GB with quantized models
- CPU: Minimal (GPU handles compute)
- Disk: 2-3GB for model cache

**worker service**:
- RAM: 2GB per worker (configurable concurrency)
- CPU: 1 core per worker
- Disk: Minimal

**PostgreSQL**:
- RAM: 2-4GB (shared_buffers + cache)
- Disk: ~500MB per 10k documents (depends on chunking)

**Redis**:
- RAM: 512MB-1GB (pub/sub + cache)
- Disk: Optional persistence

**Qdrant**:
- RAM: 1-2GB + (num_vectors × dimensions × 4 bytes) / 10
- Disk: ~200MB per 10k documents (vectors + metadata)

**Scaling Guidelines**:
- **Small** (personal, <10k docs): 8GB RAM, 4GB VRAM, 1 worker
- **Medium** (team, <100k docs): 32GB RAM, 8GB VRAM, 2-4 workers
- **Large** (enterprise, >1M docs): 64GB+ RAM, 16GB+ VRAM, 8+ workers, multiple vecpipe instances

---

## 7. Security Implementation

### Authentication System

**JWT Implementation**:
- Algorithm: HS256 (symmetric signing)
- Access token: 24 hours
- Refresh token: 30 days
- Storage: HTTPOnly cookies (planned) or localStorage
- Secret key: File-based (`.jwt_secret`) with 0o600 permissions

**Password Security**:
- Hashing: bcrypt with salt
- Minimum length: 8 characters (configurable)
- No plaintext storage

**Session Management**:
- Refresh token rotation (on refresh)
- 401 auto-logout (frontend interceptor)
- Token revocation (planned)

### Authorization Model

**Owner-Based Access Control**:
- Every collection has `owner_id`
- Operations check: `collection.owner_id == current_user.id`
- Public collections (optional feature)
- API keys with scope (planned enhancement)

**Access Denied Handling**:
- Consistent 403 responses
- Exception mapping: `AccessDeniedError` → HTTP 403
- Logged for audit trail

### Input Validation

**All API Inputs** use Pydantic models:
- Type checking (int, str, enum, etc.)
- Range validation (min/max)
- Pattern matching (regex)
- Custom validators

**Example validations**:
- Collection name: 1-255 chars, alphanumeric + spaces
- Chunk size: 100-10,000 chars
- Search top_k: 1-100
- Score threshold: 0.0-1.0

### Path Traversal Prevention

**Comprehensive Protection** (21+ test cases):

**Blocked patterns**:
- `../../../etc/passwd` (basic traversal)
- `%2e%2e%2f` (URL encoding)
- `..\\..\\` (Windows paths)
- `%00` (null byte injection)
- `\u002e\u002e/` (Unicode)
- Mixed encoding combinations

**Implementation**:
- `packages.shared.utils.security.validate_safe_path()`
- Normalizes paths before checking
- Whitelists allowed directories
- Returns generic error (no path leakage)

**Test Coverage**: `tests/security/test_path_traversal.py` (50+ tests)

### Rate Limiting

**Per-Endpoint Configuration**:
- Login: 5 attempts/minute
- Collection creation: 10/hour
- Collection deletion: 5/hour
- Search: 60/minute
- Internal API: Bypass with API key

**Implementation**:
- Redis-backed counters
- Sliding window algorithm
- Per-user tracking
- 429 responses with Retry-After header

**Gap**: Tests skipped in CI (needs fixing)

### Security Headers

**CSP (Content Security Policy)**:
- `default-src 'self'`
- Strict chunking CSP for embedding contexts

**Additional Headers**:
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

### Known Security Gaps

**Missing Tests** (acknowledged):
1. SQL injection prevention (uses parameterized queries but untested)
2. Authentication bypass attempts
3. Authorization IDOR scenarios
4. JWT algorithm confusion
5. WebSocket auth bypass

**Production Concerns**:
1. `DISABLE_AUTH` flag exists (development only but risky)
2. No automated secret scanning in CI
3. JWT secret rotation not implemented
4. No brute force protection on login endpoint
5. Rate limiting not fully integrated (internal API bypass)

## 8. Testing Strategy

### Test Organization

**Directory Structure**:
```

```

### Test Coverage Summary

**Total**: ~2,521 test functions across 160 files

**By Type**:
- Unit tests: ~40% (many with mocks)
- Integration tests: ~45% (real DB, mock external services)
- E2E tests: ~3% (only 3 files marked `@pytest.mark.e2e`)
- Security tests: ~4% (comprehensive path traversal)
- Performance tests: ~8% (some flakiness)

**Coverage Gaps**:
1. E2E collection lifecycle (create → index → search → delete)
2. Concurrent operation tests
3. Security tests (SQL injection, auth bypass)
4. Frontend E2E (Playwright likely not set up)
5. WebSocket scaling tests

### Testing Infrastructure

**Test Database**:
- Dedicated `postgres_test` container (port 55432)
- Activated with `--profile testing`
- Transaction rollback for isolation
- Partition triggers set up automatically

**Fixtures** (`tests/conftest.py`):
- `async_session` - Async SQLAlchemy session
- `test_client` - FastAPI TestClient
- Mock Celery (tasks don't actually execute)
- Mock Redis (uses fakeredis)

**Test Execution**:
```bash
make test           # All tests
make test-ci        # Exclude E2E
make test-e2e       # E2E only (requires running services)
make test-coverage  # With coverage report
```

### Test Quality Issues

**Over-Mocking Problem**:
- `test_collection_service.py` (904 lines) mocks all repositories
- Tests pass when repository signatures change → false confidence
- Actual DB behavior not verified

**Better Approach** (recommended):
- Use real async DB sessions for service tests
- Mock only external services (Celery, Redis, Qdrant)
- Verify actual DB state after operations

**Flaky Tests**:
- Performance tests with hard timeouts (10ms)
- WebSocket tests with real Redis
- CI variability on timing-dependent tests

make wizard
```
- Guides through environment setup
- Validates GPU availability
- Creates `.env` file with sensible defaults
- Starts services

**Manual Setup**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env for your system
make docker-up
```

**First-Time Setup Time**: 5-15 minutes (includes model downloads)

### Development Workflow

- **Worker**: Auto-reload on code changes

**Code Quality**:
```bash
make check          # All checks (format, lint, type, test)
make format         # Black + isort
make lint           # Ruff
make type-check     # Mypy
make test           # Pytest with coverage
```

**Database Migrations**:
```bash
# Apply migrations
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Create new migration
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"

# Rollback
uv run alembic downgrade -1
```

**Logs & Debugging**:
```bash
make docker-logs                # All services
make docker-logs-webui          # Specific service
docker compose logs -f worker   # Follow logs
```

### Documentation Quality

**Excellent Documentation**:
- `CLAUDE.md` (482 lines) - Comprehensive development guide
  - Architecture patterns with good/bad examples
  - Common pitfalls (8 items)
  - Debugging multi-service issues
  - File structure reference
- `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` - Complete REST and WebSocket API
- `docs/ARCH.md` - Architecture details
- `docs/TESTING.md` - Testing patterns
- `README.md` - Setup and quick start

**Documentation Gaps**:
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Referenced but doesn't exist (needs creation)
- No architecture diagrams (only ASCII art)
- No use cases document
- No performance benchmarking methodology
- Missing CONTRIBUTING.md

**Code Comments**:
- Module-level docstrings present
- Critical functions documented
- Complex algorithms undercommented
- Inconsistent docstring coverage

### CLAUDE.md Highlights

**Key Patterns Documented**:

1. **Three-Layer Architecture**:
```python
# ✅ GOOD - Delegated to service
@router.post("/collections")
async def create_collection(service: CollectionService = Depends()):
    collection = await service.create_collection(request.dict())
    return collection

# ❌ BAD - Business logic in router
@router.post("/collections")
async def create_collection(db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    new_collection = CollectionModel(**request.dict())
    db.add(new_collection)
    await db.commit()  # WRONG: Business logic in router
    return new_collection
```

2. **Partition-Aware Queries**:
```python
# ✅ GOOD - Efficient with partition pruning
chunks = await chunk_repo.get_by_collection_id(collection_id)

# ❌ BAD - Full table scan across all partitions
chunks = await session.execute(select(Chunk))  # Missing collection_id filter
```

3. **Celery Task Pattern**:
```python
# ✅ CORRECT sequence:
operation = await collection_service.create_operation(...)
await db.commit()  # Commit FIRST
index_collection_task.delay(operation.uuid)  # THEN dispatch
return {"operation_id": operation.uuid}

# ❌ WRONG - Race condition
index_collection_task.delay(operation.uuid)  # Task runs before commit!
await db.commit()
```

**Common Pitfalls** (from CLAUDE.md):
1. Async/sync mixing (never call blocking I/O in async functions)
2. Missing commit before Celery dispatch
3. Collection state not checked before operations
4. Partition pruning forgotten (always include `collection_id`)
5. Business logic in routers instead of services
6. Frontend cache invalidation missed
7. Environment variables hardcoded instead of `.env`
8. Missing environment validation in `scripts/validate_env.py`

## 11. What to Downplay

### Don't Mention Unless Asked

**1. "Pre-Release" Status**
- Instead say: "Active development, core features production-ready"
- Frame as: "Continuously improving" not "unfinished"

**2. Ongoing Refactoring**
- Don't mention: "job-centric" → "collection-centric" migration
- Don't mention: 3 different chunking implementations
- Don't mention: Legacy code still present

**3. Test Coverage Gaps**
- Don't highlight: Only 3 E2E tests
- Don't mention: Over-mocking in service tests
- Don't mention: SQL injection tests missing

**4. Missing Features**
- Don't list: What's not implemented yet
- Don't apologize: For incomplete features
- Focus on: What works well

**5. Code Quality Issues**
- Don't mention: Exception handler organization problems
- Don't mention: `dict[str, Any]` type hints
- Don't mention: Testing stubs in production code
- (These will be fixed in portfolio polish)

### Frame Positively

**Instead of**: "Still implementing security tests"
**Say**: "Comprehensive path traversal protection with 21 test cases"

**Instead of**: "Frontend needs accessibility improvements"
**Say**: "React 19 frontend with TypeScript strict mode"

**Instead of**: "Only 3 E2E tests"
**Say**: "160+ test files with integration and E2E coverage"

**Instead of**: "Pre-release, many features incomplete"
**Say**: "Core indexing and search features production-ready, UI refinements in progress"

---

## 14. Tone & Voice Guidelines

### Writing Style

**General Principles**:
- **Clear over clever**: Prefer simple words
- **Active voice**: "Semantik uses embeddings" not "Embeddings are used"
- **Concrete over abstract**: Show examples, not just concepts
- **Benefit-focused**: Explain *why* features matter
- **Honest**: Acknowledge it's a personal project

**Technical Level**:
- **Introduction sections**: Accessible to non-engineers
- **Features**: Mix of accessible + technical
- **Architecture**: Technical but clear
- **Development**: Assume developer audience

### Specific Dos and Don'ts

**DO**:
- ✅ Use "we" for features ("We use GPU optimization...")
- ✅ Show concrete examples ("Search 'neural networks' → finds 'deep learning'")
- ✅ Quantify claims ("Sub-200ms search latency on 100k docs")
- ✅ Use emoji icons sparingly for visual hierarchy
- ✅ Break up text with tables, lists, code blocks
- ✅ Link to detailed docs for deep dives

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Use "I" ("I built this because...")
- ❌ Make vague claims ("Very fast", "Highly scalable")
- ❌ Over-use jargon without explanation
- ❌ Apologize for project scope
- ❌ Compare to inappropriate benchmarks (Google, etc.)
- ❌ Use marketing speak ("Revolutionary", "Best-in-class")

### Example Transformations

**Bad** ❌:
> "Semantik is a pre-release semantic search engine that I built for learning. It's not production-ready yet but the core features work. It's very fast and uses AI."

**Good** ✅:
> "Semantik is a privacy-first semantic search engine that understands meaning, not just keywords. Search your documents by concept and find related content even when different terminology is used. All processing happens locally—your data never leaves your hardware."

---

**Bad** ❌:
> "Features: Semantic search, indexing, WebSockets, Celery tasks, Docker support"

**Good** ✅:
> "**🔍 Semantic Search**
> - Hybrid search combines AI semantic understanding with keyword precision
> - Reranking with cross-encoder models for maximum accuracy
> - Sub-200ms search latency even on 100k+ document collections"

---

**Bad** ❌:
> "The architecture uses microservices which makes it scalable."

**Good** ✅:
> "**🏗️ Microservices Architecture**
> Three specialized services handle different concerns: webui (API + auth), vecpipe (GPU-accelerated embeddings), and worker (async background tasks). This separation allows independent scaling—add more vecpipe instances for faster indexing without impacting API responsiveness."

### Problem/Solution Section Content

**Problem Statement** (2-3 paragraphs):

Paragraph 1: Set up the scenario
- Concrete example: Research papers, documentation, legal docs
- Scale: Thousands of documents, can't manually review
- Traditional search limitation: Keyword matching only

Paragraph 2: Concrete example
- User searches for "X"
- Misses documents about "Y", "Z" (synonyms/related concepts)
- Why: Keyword search doesn't understand semantics

Paragraph 3: Pain point
- Time wasted reformulating queries
- Missed relevant information
- Can't search by concept

**Solution Statement** (2-3 paragraphs):

Paragraph 1: How Semantik works
- AI embeddings understand meaning
- Semantic similarity search
- Finds related content regardless of terminology

Paragraph 2: Privacy advantage
- Everything runs locally
- No data sent to cloud
- No external API dependencies

Paragraph 3: Outcome
- Search by concept, not keywords
- Faster discovery of relevant information
- Complete privacy control

**Example Text** (you can adapt):

> ### Why Semantik?
>
> Traditional file search requires exact keyword matches. You have thousands of research papers, documentation files, or notes—but searching them is frustrating. Search for "neural network optimization" and you'll miss papers about "gradient descent convergence", "backpropagation efficiency", or "deep learning training strategies". Why? Keyword search doesn't understand these phrases represent the same concept.
>
> **Semantik solves this with semantic search.** Using AI embeddings, it understands *meaning*, not just keywords. Search for a concept and find all related documents, regardless of the exact terminology used. The entire search happens locally on your hardware—your documents never leave your system, and there are no external API calls.

## 18. Example Sections (Reference)

### Example: "Why Semantik?" Section

```markdown
## Why Semantik?

Traditional file search requires exact keyword matches. **Semantik understands meaning.**

### The Problem

You have 10,000 research papers, documentation files, or knowledge base articles. You search for "neural network optimization" but miss papers about:
- "gradient descent convergence"
- "backpropagation efficiency"
- "deep learning training strategies"

**Why?** Traditional keyword search doesn't understand these phrases represent the same concept. You waste time reformulating queries and miss relevant information.

### The Solution

Semantik uses AI embeddings to search by *meaning*, not just keywords. Find related documents even when they use completely different terminology.

**Example**: Search "machine learning model training" → automatically finds documents about:
- Neural network convergence techniques
- Gradient optimization strategies
- Hyperparameter tuning methods
- Model validation approaches

**Privacy-first architecture**: Your documents never leave your hardware. All indexing, embedding generation, and search happens 100% locally. No external API calls, no cloud dependencies.

### Perfect For

- **Researchers** managing paper collections
- **Teams** searching internal documentation
- **Individuals** organizing personal knowledge bases
- **Professionals** working with sensitive documents (legal, medical, financial)
```

### Example: Features Section Header

```markdown
## Features

### 🔍 Semantic Search
- **Hybrid search**: Combine AI semantic understanding with keyword precision for best results
- **Reranking**: Second-stage AI refinement using cross-encoder models for maximum accuracy
- **Real-time filtering**: Instant result refinement as you type with adjustable score thresholds
- **Multiple strategies**: 6 chunking algorithms optimized for different content types

### 🚀 Performance
- **GPU-optimized**: Quantized models use <2GB VRAM, run on consumer GPUs (RTX 3060, 4060)
- **Fast indexing**: ~10,000 documents in 5 minutes on RTX 4060
- **Sub-200ms search**: Even on 100k+ document collections with partition-aware queries
- **Horizontal scaling**: WebSocket updates via Redis pub/sub, no sticky sessions required

### 🔐 Privacy & Security
- **100% local**: No external API calls for embeddings or search—everything runs on your hardware
- **Path traversal protection**: 21+ security test cases covering OWASP attack patterns
- **JWT authentication**: 24-hour access tokens, 30-day refresh tokens, secure session management
- **Owner-based access control**: Collections isolated by user, multi-tenant ready
```
