## Key Findings at a Glance

### Duplication
- **11 major instances** of code duplication
- **800-1200 lines** of estimated duplicate code
- **85-90%** duplication in worst cases
- **Impact**: Maintenance nightmare, bug propagation

### Complexity
- **3 critical God Objects** (3710, 2983, 1286 LOC)
- **242 cyclomatic complexity** in ChunkingService
- **40+ functions** exceeding 50 LOC
- **15+ architectural responsibilities** in single classes

### Architecture
- **14 chunking-related files** with overlapping functionality
- **Potential circular dependencies** between services
- **Unclear module organization** (split across 2 locations)
- **No clear dependency injection** pattern

### Frontend
- **Large monolithic components** (794, 582 LOC)
- **8+ state variables** in single component
- **Multiple data fetching** queries not coordinated
- **Complex async workflows** difficult to follow

## Refactoring Priorities

### URGENT (Next Sprint) - 6 hours
1. Extract ProgressUpdateManager (4h)
   - Files: chunking_tasks.py, tasks.py, websocket_manager.py
   - Impact: Remove ~180 lines of duplication

2. Create ErrorClassifier (2h)
   - Files: chunking_tasks.py, error_handler.py
   - Impact: Remove ~50 lines of duplication

3. Consolidate defaults (1h)
   - Files: 3 config builder files
   - Impact: Single source of truth

### HIGH (1-2 Sprints) - 40 hours
1. Refactor ChunkingService (40h)
   - Split 3710 LOC into 5-6 services
   - Impact: 70% reduction in LOC

2. Consolidate chunking modules (30h)
   - Merge 14 files into 4-5 organized modules
   - Impact: Clearer architecture

### MEDIUM (2-4 Sprints) - 20 hours
1. Extract React components (20h)
   - Split large modals into smaller pieces
   - Impact: Better reusability, easier testing

## Next Steps

1. **Review** the appropriate report(s) based on your role:
   - Managers: Read AUDIT_SUMMARY.txt
   - Tech leads: Read CODE_AUDIT_REPORT.md
   - Engineers: Read AUDIT_DETAILED_FINDINGS.md

2. **Prioritize** which refactoring phase to tackle:
   - Phase 1 (Urgent): Extract utilities, remove duplication
   - Phase 2 (High): Major architecture refactoring
   - Phase 3 (Medium): Frontend cleanup

3. **Plan** refactoring work:
   - Create tickets for Priority 1 items
   - Schedule architecture review
   - Set up code review process

4. **Track progress**:
   - Monitor metric improvements
   - Set goals for next audit
