# Semantik Test Coverage Plan (Revised)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to improve test coverage across the Semantik codebase. The current test suite has good infrastructure but significant coverage gaps, particularly in critical components and integration points. This revised plan addresses architectural concerns, security testing, performance validation, and proper dependency ordering.

### Key Findings
- **Backend**: Strong pytest infrastructure with 0% coverage on many critical modules
- **Frontend**: No automated testing framework installed; only manual HTML tests exist
- **Architectural Issues**: `embedding_service.py` is in webui but used by vecpipe, creating dependency inversion
- **Critical Gaps**: WebSocket functionality, security testing, integration tests, performance benchmarks

### Recommended Approach
1. Address architectural issues first (refactor shared components)
2. Implement comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, property-based, load)
3. Target 80% coverage for critical paths, 70% overall within 3 months
4. Establish security and performance testing baselines

## Current State Assessment

### Backend Testing (Python/Pytest)
- **Framework**: Well-configured pytest with async support, coverage reporting, and fixtures
- **Coverage**: HTML and terminal reporting configured but many modules at 0%
- **Organization**: Clear separation of unit/integration/E2E tests
- **Gaps**: WebSocket testing, security validation, load testing

### Frontend Testing (React)
- **Framework**: None installed
- **Current Tests**: Manual HTML files and Python API test scripts
- **Coverage**: 0% automated test coverage
- **Needs**: Modern testing framework with component and integration testing

## Architectural Improvements Required

### Pre-Testing Refactors
1. **Move `embedding_service.py`** from webui to vecpipe or create shared package
2. **Abstract database access** in `cleanup.py` to remove direct SQLite dependency
3. **Create interfaces** for cross-package communication

## Priority Matrix (Revised)

### ðŸš¨ Immediate (Week 0)
Architectural fixes and security issues that block proper testing.

### ðŸ”´ Critical Priority (Week 1-2)
Core functionality, security-critical components, and testing infrastructure.

### ðŸŸ¡ High Priority (Week 3-4)
Integration tests, performance validation, and user-facing features.

### ðŸŸ¢ Medium Priority (Week 5-6)

## Appendix: Testing Best Practices

### Code Examples

#### Property-Based Testing Example
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(
    text=st.text(min_size=100, max_size=10000),
    chunk_size=st.integers(min_value=50, max_value=500),
    overlap=st.integers(min_value=0, max_value=50)
)
def test_chunking_preserves_text(text, chunk_size, overlap):
    chunks = chunk_text(text, chunk_size, overlap)
    # Verify all text is preserved
    reconstructed = "".join(chunk.text for chunk in chunks)
    assert text in reconstructed
```

#### WebSocket Testing Example
```python
async def test_websocket_broadcast():
    manager = ConnectionManager()
    
    # Connect multiple clients
    clients = [MockWebSocket() for _ in range(5)]
    for client in clients:
        await manager.connect(client, job_id="test-job")
    
    # Broadcast message
    await manager.broadcast_to_job("test-job", {"status": "processing"})
    
    # Verify all clients received
    for client in clients:
        assert client.sent_messages[-1] == {"status": "processing"}
```

#### Contract Testing Example
```python
# Consumer test (webui)
@pact.given("search service is available")
@pact.upon_receiving("a search request")
@pact.with_request(method="POST", path="/search")
@pact.will_respond_with(200, body=Like({
    "results": EachLike({"content": String(), "score": Float()}),
    "total": Integer()
}))
def test_search_contract(client):
    response = client.post("/search", json={"query": "test"})
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

This revised plan addresses the critical gaps identified and provides a more comprehensive approach to testing the Semantik codebase.
