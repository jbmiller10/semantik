# Docker Infrastructure Review for Project Semantik

## Executive Summary

The Docker infrastructure and testing configuration has been substantially updated to support service separation. The implementation shows good practices with proper service isolation, health checks, security configurations, and volume management. However, there are some areas that need attention, particularly around GPU configuration consistency and CI/CD coverage.

## Docker Configuration Status

### ✅ Service Separation

**docker-compose.yml** properly defines three separate services:
- **qdrant**: Vector database service with appropriate resource limits and health checks
- **vecpipe**: Search API service (packages/vecpipe) with GPU support
- **webui**: Web UI service (packages/webui) with GPU support

Each service has:
- Proper container naming convention
- Health checks with appropriate intervals
- Resource limits (CPU and memory)
- Security configurations (no-new-privileges, capability drops)
- Restart policies

### ✅ Volume Configuration

Volume mounts are properly configured:
- **Read-only document mount**: `${DOCUMENT_PATH:-./documents}:/mnt/docs:ro` for webui
- **Shared data volumes**: Both services mount `./data` and `./logs` for persistence
- **Model cache**: HuggingFace cache directory shared between services
- **Named volume**: Qdrant uses a named volume for data persistence

### ⚠️ Service Dependencies

Dependencies are correctly set:
- webui depends on vecpipe
- vecpipe depends on qdrant

However, the entrypoint script uses network-based waiting rather than Docker's native health check dependency, which could be improved.

## Infrastructure Components

### ✅ Dockerfile Structure

Both Dockerfiles (standard and CUDA) follow multi-stage build patterns:
1. **Frontend builder stage**: Builds React app
2. **Python dependencies stage**: Installs Poetry and Python packages
3. **Runtime stage**: Final minimal image with proper user permissions

Key features:
- Non-root user (appuser with UID 1000)
- Proper directory permissions
- PYTHONPATH correctly set to `/app/packages`
- Frontend static files copied to webui package

### ✅ Docker Entrypoint

The `docker-entrypoint.sh` script provides:
- Service-specific startup logic
- Environment variable validation
- Service readiness checks
- Database initialization for webui

### ✅ Environment Configuration

`.env.docker.example` provides comprehensive configuration:
- JWT secret generation instructions
- GPU configuration options
- Quantization settings with memory usage examples
- Service configuration parameters
- Rate limiting options

## Testing Infrastructure Updates

### ✅ Makefile Updates

The Makefile has been updated with Docker-specific commands:
- `make wizard`: Interactive Docker setup
- `make docker-up`: Complete setup with directory permissions and JWT generation
- `make docker-down/logs/ps/restart`: Standard Docker operations
- `make docker-build-fresh`: Clean rebuild
- Service-specific log commands

### ✅ CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
- Uses Qdrant service container
- Runs linting, type checking, and tests
- Excludes E2E tests (marked with pytest markers)
- Uses mock embeddings for CI testing
- Coverage reporting with Codecov

### ✅ Package Structure

The refactoring introduces a `shared` package:
```
packages/
├── shared/        # New shared components
├── vecpipe/       # Search API service
└── webui/         # Web UI service
```

The pyproject.toml correctly includes all three packages.

## Missing or Incomplete Components

### 1. Docker CPU-only Configuration
While mentioned in comments, there's no explicit `docker-compose.cpu.yml` override file for CPU-only deployments.

### 2. Production TLS/SSL
The production compose file mentions TLS handled by reverse proxy, but nginx.conf.example is referenced but not reviewed.

### 3. Docker Secrets Management
While the Makefile generates JWT secrets, there's no Docker secrets integration for production deployments.

### 4. Container Registry Configuration
No configuration for pushing images to a registry for production deployments.

### 5. Kubernetes Manifests
No Kubernetes deployment manifests for cloud deployments.

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Implemented Security Features
- Non-root user in containers
- Capability drops and no-new-privileges
- Read-only volume mounts where appropriate
- JWT secret generation in Makefile
- Resource limits to prevent DoS

### ⚠️ Security Improvements Needed
- No network policies defined
- Database credentials are hardcoded (SQLite, but principle applies)
- No secrets rotation mechanism
- Missing security scanning in CI pipeline

## Recommendations for Improvements

### 1. **Improve Service Startup Coordination**
Replace network-based waiting in entrypoint with Docker health check dependencies:
```yaml
depends_on:
  qdrant:
    condition: service_healthy
```

### 2. **Add CPU-only Docker Compose Override**
Create `docker-compose.cpu.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  vecpipe:
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices: []  # Remove GPU reservation
  webui:
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices: []  # Remove GPU reservation
```

### 3. **Enhance CI/CD Pipeline**
- Add Docker image building and scanning
- Add E2E tests with Docker Compose in CI
- Add security scanning (Trivy, Snyk)
- Cache Docker layers in CI

### 4. **Implement Proper Secrets Management**
```yaml
secrets:
  jwt_secret:
    external: true
services:
  webui:
    secrets:
      - jwt_secret
```

### 5. **Add Development Docker Compose Override**
Create `docker-compose.dev.yml` for development with:
- Volume mounts for code hot-reloading
- Debug ports exposed
- Development environment variables

### 6. **Document GPU Memory Requirements**
Add a table in documentation showing memory requirements for different models and quantization levels.

### 7. **Add Container Health Monitoring**
Integrate Prometheus metrics exposed by services into a monitoring stack.

### 8. **Create Backup and Restore Procedures**
Document procedures for backing up Qdrant data and SQLite database.

## Conclusion

The Docker infrastructure refactoring is well-executed with proper service separation, security considerations, and development workflow integration. The main areas for improvement are around production readiness features like secrets management, monitoring, and CPU-only deployment options. The testing infrastructure has been updated appropriately, though E2E testing in CI could be enhanced.

The refactoring successfully achieves the goal of separating vecpipe and webui services while maintaining a shared codebase through the new shared package structure. This provides a solid foundation for scaling and deploying the services independently.
