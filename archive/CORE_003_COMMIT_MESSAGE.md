feat: Complete CORE-003 embedding service migration with comprehensive testing

Major refactoring to resolve architectural dependency inversion:
- Migrated embedding service from webui to shared package
- Implemented abstract base class for extensibility
- Maintained full backwards compatibility
- Added comprehensive test suite and documentation

Architecture improvements:
- Clean separation: vecpipe → shared ← webui
- Async-first design with sync wrapper
- Thread-safe singleton pattern
- Support for future embedding types (sparse, hybrid)

Testing:
- 25 new tests covering all aspects
- Thread safety verification (8 tests)
- Full integration tests (9 tests)
- Performance benchmarks showing improved async throughput
- All tests passing with mock mode for fast CI/CD

Documentation:
- Comprehensive development log (CORE_003_DEV_LOG.md)
- Test suite summary (CORE_003_TEST_SUMMARY.md)
- Full API documentation in README
- Migration notes for next developer

Technical details:
- Type-safe with full mypy compliance
- INT8 compatibility checking preserved
- OOM recovery mechanisms maintained
- Centralized model configuration

Breaking changes: None (backwards compatible)

Files changed:
- Created: 7 new files in packages/shared/embedding/
- Created: 5 new test files
- Modified: 14 files (import updates)
- Deleted: packages/webui/embedding_service.py (moved)

Next steps documented in CORE_003_DEV_LOG.md
