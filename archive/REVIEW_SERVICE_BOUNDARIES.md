# Service Boundaries Review - Project Semantik Refactoring

## Executive Summary

The refactoring has successfully established proper service boundaries between packages. **No circular dependencies were found**, and the separation of concerns has been properly implemented according to the intended architecture.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Import Analysis

#### vecpipe Package
✅ **NO imports from webui package found**
- All vecpipe modules only import from:
  - Standard library modules
  - Third-party packages (qdrant_client, torch, etc.)
  - The `shared` package
  - Internal vecpipe modules

#### webui Package  
✅ **NO imports from vecpipe internals found**
- All webui modules only import from:
  - Standard library modules
  - Third-party packages (fastapi, httpx, etc.)
  - The `shared` package
  - Internal webui modules

#### shared Package
✅ **Properly serves as the common dependency layer**
- Contains shared contracts, configurations, and services
- Both vecpipe and webui import from shared
- No reverse dependencies (shared doesn't import from vecpipe or webui)

### 2. Service Communication

✅ **webui communicates with vecpipe only through HTTP API calls**
- Evidence found in `/packages/webui/api/search.py`:
  - Uses `httpx.AsyncClient` to make HTTP requests
  - Calls to `{settings.SEARCH_API_URL}/search` for vector search
  - Calls to `{settings.SEARCH_API_URL}/hybrid_search` for hybrid search
  - Properly handles timeouts and retries for model loading scenarios

### 3. Database Access Patterns

✅ **No direct SQLite database access from vecpipe**
- The webui SQLite database (`webui.db`) is only accessed by webui modules
- vecpipe uses its own JSON-based file tracking database (`file_tracking.json`)
- No cross-package database access found

### 4. Cleanup Service Refactoring

✅ **cleanup.py successfully replaced with maintenance.py**
- No `cleanup.py` file exists in the codebase
- New `maintenance.py` properly uses HTTP API for cross-service communication:
  - Calls webui's internal API endpoint `/api/internal/jobs/all-ids`
  - No direct database access from vecpipe
  - Maintains proper service boundaries

### 5. Dependency Graph

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   vecpipe   │     │    webui    │
└──────┬──────┘     └──────┬──────┘
       │                   │
       │                   │ HTTP API calls
       │                   ├─────────────────→ vecpipe/search_api
       │                   │
       └─────────┬─────────┘
                 │
                 ▼
          ┌─────────────┐
          │   shared    │
          └─────────────┘
```

### 6. Shared Services Architecture

The `shared` package properly contains:
- **Configuration**: Base, vecpipe, and webui specific configs
- **Contracts**: Search, jobs, and error contracts for API communication
- **Embedding Service**: Shared embedding functionality
- **Text Processing**: Extraction and chunking utilities
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics collection

## Specific Files Reviewed

### No Issues Found In:
- `/packages/vecpipe/search_api.py` - Properly exposes REST API
- `/packages/vecpipe/maintenance.py` - Uses HTTP API for webui communication
- `/packages/webui/api/search.py` - Correctly proxies to vecpipe via HTTP
- `/packages/webui/api/internal.py` - Provides internal API for maintenance service
- All import statements across both packages

## Recommendations

### 1. Already Implemented Well:
- Service boundaries are properly enforced
- No circular dependencies exist
- Communication happens through well-defined HTTP APIs
- Shared functionality is properly abstracted

### 2. Minor Enhancement Opportunities:
1. **API Client Library**: Consider creating a typed client library in the shared package for vecpipe API calls to improve type safety and reduce boilerplate in webui.

2. **API Versioning**: As the services evolve independently, consider implementing API versioning to ensure backward compatibility.

3. **Service Discovery**: For production deployments, consider implementing service discovery instead of hardcoded URLs in settings.

## Conclusion

The refactoring has successfully achieved its goals:
- ✅ Eliminated circular dependencies
- ✅ Established clear service boundaries  
- ✅ Implemented proper inter-service communication via HTTP APIs
- ✅ Removed direct database access across packages
- ✅ Created a clean shared package for common functionality

The architecture now follows microservices best practices while maintaining the monorepo structure, allowing for independent deployment and scaling of the vecpipe and webui services.
