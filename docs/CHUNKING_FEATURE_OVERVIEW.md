# Semantik Chunking Feature - Overview & Context

## Executive Summary

This document provides context for all developers working on Semantik's chunking system implementation. We're building a modern, intelligent document chunking system that will form the foundation of Semantik's semantic search capabilities.

**Timeline**: 4 weeks (includes buffer for unexpected issues)  
**Approach**: Clean implementation with enhanced architecture based on review feedback  
**Goal**: World-class document chunking supporting 6 strategies across 40+ file types  
**Code Support**: Deferred to follow-up release (~2 weeks post-launch)

---

## Why Chunking Matters

### The Problem
When storing documents in a vector database for semantic search, we need to split them into smaller, meaningful pieces called "chunks". Poor chunking leads to:
- 🔍 **Bad search results**: Relevant content is missed or buried
- 💭 **Lost context**: Important information is split across chunks
- 💰 **Wasted resources**: Inefficient chunks increase costs and reduce performance
- 😤 **User frustration**: Users can't find what they're looking for

### Our Solution
We're implementing a comprehensive chunking system based on the "5 Levels of Text Splitting" that adapts to different content types and use cases. This will give Semantik users:
- **Better search quality**: Find exactly what they're looking for
- **Preserved context**: Chunks maintain semantic meaning
- **Optimal performance**: Right-sized chunks for speed and accuracy
- **Flexibility**: Choose the best strategy for their content

---

## The Vision

### Current State (What We're Replacing)
- Basic token-based chunking only
- Supports only 8 file types
- No user control over chunking
- One-size-fits-all approach

### Future State (What We're Building)
- **6 intelligent strategies** from simple to AI-powered embeddings
- **40+ supported file types** with smart detection
- **User-configurable** per collection
- **Automatic optimization** based on content type
- **Real-time analytics** to measure and improve
- **Code support roadmap** clearly communicated

---

## Implementation Approach

Based on architectural review feedback, we're taking an **enhanced clean-slate approach**:
- ✅ **No backwards compatibility** constraints
- ✅ **Service-oriented architecture** with ChunkingService layer
- ✅ **Normalized database schema** for performance at scale
- ✅ **Security-first design** with comprehensive validation
- ✅ **Best-in-class libraries** (LlamaIndex, sentence-transformers)
- ✅ **Performance benchmarks** defined upfront
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** and recovery
- ✅ **Phased feature delivery** (code support in follow-up)

## The 6 Chunking Strategies

### Level 1: Basic
1. **Character** (TokenTextSplitter) - Simple fixed-size splitting for basic needs

### Level 2: Smart Text Splitting  
2. **Recursive** (SentenceSplitter) - Intelligent general-purpose splitting (our recommended default)
   - Also handles code files with optimized parameters until dedicated support arrives

### Level 3: Document-Aware
3. **Markdown** (MarkdownNodeParser) - Respects headers and formatting in technical docs

### Level 4: Advanced
4. **Semantic** (SemanticSplitterNodeParser) - Uses AI embeddings to find natural topic boundaries
5. **Hierarchical** (HierarchicalNodeParser) - Creates parent-child chunks for better context
6. **Hybrid** - Automatically switches strategies based on content

### Note on Code Files
Code files (.py, .js, .java, etc.) are fully supported using optimized recursive chunking:
- Smaller chunk sizes (400 vs 600 characters)
- Reduced overlap for efficiency
- Line-break aware splitting

Dedicated code-aware chunking with syntax understanding is planned for ~2 weeks post-launch.

### 1. **Service Layer Architecture**
```python
ChunkingService       # Business logic separation
├── Security validation
├── Caching layer
├── Error handling
└── Analytics tracking
```

### 2. **Normalized Database Schema**
- Separate tables for strategies, configs, and metrics
- Partitioned chunks table for scale (16 partitions)
- Materialized views for performance
- Proper indexes throughout

### 3. **Security Throughout**
- Input validation at every layer
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Parameter bounds checking
- Document size limits

### 4. **Performance Targets**
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Why not include code support at launch?
**A**: Code chunking is complex and deserves dedicated focus. By deferring it, we can ship faster and build better code support based on real usage data.

### Q: How well does recursive chunking work for code?
**A**: Quite well! With optimized parameters (smaller chunks, less overlap), it maintains readability and searchability. It's ~80% as good as dedicated code chunking.

### Q: What changed from the original plan?
**A**: Based on review feedback: added buffer time (3.5→4 weeks), enhanced architecture, concrete performance targets, comprehensive error handling, and security throughout.

### Q: When will code support arrive?
**A**: Approximately 2 weeks after launch. We'll use insights from initial usage to build excellent language-aware chunking.

### Q: Will I need to re-index when code support arrives?
**A**: You'll have the option to re-index for improved results, but existing chunks will continue to work.

### Q: Why 40+ file types?
**A**: Covers all common document, code, and data formats users need.
