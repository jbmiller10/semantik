## Development Progress

### 2025-07-16 - Initial Setup
- Reviewed Phase 3 requirements from COLLECTIONS_REFACTOR_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
- Analyzed existing codebase:
  - Current tasks.py has basic process_collection_operation implementation
  - Prometheus metrics infrastructure exists in packages/shared/metrics/prometheus.py
  - Database models include CollectionAuditLog, OperationMetrics, CollectionResourceLimits
- Created development log to track progress

### 2025-07-16 - Completed Phase 3 Implementation
- **Enhanced Metrics**: Created comprehensive collection operation metrics in `collection_metrics.py`
  - Added counters for operations, errors, retries
  - Added histograms for durations and latencies
  - Added gauges for collection statistics
  - Implemented context managers for timing operations
- **Enhanced Task Processing**: Updated `process_collection_operation` with:
  - Comprehensive monitoring using Prometheus metrics
  - Resource tracking (CPU, memory)
  - Performance metrics recording in database
  - Proper error handling and retry logic
  - Audit logging for all operations
- **Blue-Green Reindex**: Implemented complete reindex operation with:
  - 6 validation checkpoints (preflight, staging, reprocessing, validation, switch, cleanup)
  - Staging collection creation
  - Validation comparing old and new collections
  - Atomic switch with rollback capability
  - Comprehensive error handling and cleanup
- **Resource Management**: Created ResourceManager with:
  - User quota management
  - Resource estimation for operations
  - System resource checking
  - Reservation system for reindex operations
- **Operation Handlers**: Enhanced all operation handlers with monitoring:
  - INDEX: Added Qdrant operation timing and audit logging
  - APPEND: Added document processing metrics and progress tracking
  - REINDEX: Complete blue-green implementation with validation
  - REMOVE_SOURCE: Added batch removal with progress updates

## Key Files Modified
- `/home/dockertest/semantik/PHASE_3_DEV_LOG.md` - Created and updated development log
- `/home/dockertest/semantik/packages/shared/metrics/collection_metrics.py` - Created comprehensive metrics module
- `/home/dockertest/semantik/packages/webui/tasks.py` - Enhanced with monitoring and validation
- `/home/dockertest/semantik/packages/webui/services/resource_manager.py` - Created resource management service
- `/home/dockertest/semantik/packages/webui/services/factory.py` - Added resource manager factory

## Design Decisions
- Will extend existing Prometheus metrics rather than replace them
- Keep backward compatibility with existing task structure
- Use database OperationMetrics model for detailed performance tracking
- Implement blue-green reindex as a separate handler with validation steps

## Notes
- Current implementation already has basic operation handlers for INDEX, APPEND, REINDEX, REMOVE_SOURCE
- Enhanced all handlers with comprehensive monitoring, validation, and resource management
- The reindex operation now has full blue-green deployment with validation checkpoints

## Summary
Phase 3 implementation is complete. All tasks have been successfully implemented:

1. **Monitoring & Metrics**: Added comprehensive Prometheus metrics for all collection operations
2. **Performance Tracking**: Database recording of operation metrics (duration, CPU, memory)
3. **Blue-Green Reindex**: Full implementation with 6 checkpoints and validation
4. **Resource Management**: User quotas, resource estimation, and reservation system
5. **Audit Logging**: All operations now create audit log entries

The implementation follows the execution plan closely while maintaining backward compatibility. The enhanced task processing provides better observability, reliability, and resource management for production use.

## Next Steps
- Phase 4: API Implementation with Security (1.5 weeks)
- Phase 5: Frontend Implementation with UX Enhancements (2 weeks)
- Phase 6: Testing & Documentation (1 week)
- Phase 7: Operational Validation (1 week)

## TASK-009: Refactor Celery Task Structure

### 2025-07-16 - Starting TASK-009 Implementation
- **Task**: Refactor Celery task structure to create a unified, robust task entry point
- **Requirements**:
  1. Add `acks_late=True` for message reliability
  2. Define proper `soft_time_limit` and `time_limit`
  3. Update operations record with `celery_task_id` as first action in task
  4. Implement try...finally block for guaranteed status updates
- **Analysis**:
  - Current task has basic configuration but missing reliability features
  - Task ID is being set by CollectionService after task submission
  - Found broken `operation_repo.update()` call that needs fixing
  - Need to move task_id update inside the task as first action

### 2025-07-16 - Completed TASK-009 Implementation
- **Changes Made**:
  1. **Enhanced Celery Task Decorator** (packages/webui/tasks.py):
     - Added `acks_late=True` for message reliability
     - Set `soft_time_limit=3600` (1 hour) and `time_limit=7200` (2 hours)
     - Kept existing retry configuration (max_retries=3, default_retry_delay=60)
  2. **Moved Task ID Update Inside Task**:
     - Task ID is now set as the FIRST action using `self.request.id`
     - Fixed broken `operation_repo.update()` by using `set_task_id()` method
     - Ensures task tracking even if later steps fail
  3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
     - Wrapped exception handler updates in try-except to ensure robustness
     - Added finally block logic to guarantee final status updates
     - Added fallback to set FAILED status if task terminates unexpectedly
  4. **Updated CollectionService**:
     - Removed redundant `set_task_id()` calls in 4 locations
     - Added comments explaining task ID is now set inside the task
- **Benefits**:
  - Improved message reliability with late acknowledgment
  - Better handling of long-running operations with proper timeouts
  - Guaranteed task ID tracking for monitoring and cancellation
  - More robust error handling with guaranteed status updates
