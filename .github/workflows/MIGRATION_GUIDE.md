# CI/CD Migration Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the consolidation of 4 separate GitHub Actions workflows into a single, efficient pipeline.

## Changes Made

### Removed Workflows
- `ci.yml` - Basic CI (replaced by quality-checks job)
- `frontend-tests.yml` - Frontend tests (replaced by frontend-tests job)
- `test-all.yml` - Full test suite (replaced by backend-tests + frontend-tests)
- `pr-checks.yml` - PR checks (replaced by pr-analysis job)

### New Consolidated Workflow: `main.yml`

The new workflow provides:

1. **Parallel execution** - Quality checks run in parallel with security scans
2. **Efficient caching** - Poetry, pip, npm, and Docker layer caching
3. **Single source of truth** - One workflow file to maintain
4. **Consistent environments** - Unified Python (3.11) and Node.js (20.x) versions
5. **Security scanning** - Added Trivy for vulnerability detection
6. **Build validation** - Docker image builds are tested

## Performance Improvements

### Before
- Total workflow runs per PR: 4
- Average CI time: ~15-20 minutes (cumulative)
- Cache usage: Minimal
- Redundant operations: High

### After
- Total workflow runs per PR: 1
- Expected CI time: ~8-10 minutes
- Cache usage: Comprehensive
- Redundant operations: None

## Key Features

### 1. Concurrency Control
```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```
Prevents redundant runs when pushing multiple commits.

### 2. Comprehensive Caching
- Poetry installation and virtualenv
- Node modules (root and frontend)
- Docker build layers (BuildKit)

### 3. Security Integration
- Trivy vulnerability scanning
- Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Python dependency scanning with Safety

### 4. Streamlined Jobs
- **quality-checks**: All linting/formatting in one job
- **security-scan**: Vulnerability detection
- **backend-tests**: Python tests with services
- **frontend-tests**: React component tests
- **build-validation**: Ensures everything builds
- **pr-analysis**: PR-specific information

## Migration Steps

1. **Update branch protection rules**:
   - Remove old status checks
   - Add new required checks:
     - `quality-checks`
     - `backend-tests`
     - `frontend-tests`
     - `build-validation`
     - `ci-summary`

2. **Add secrets** (if not already present):
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN` - For coverage uploads
   - `SAFETY_API_KEY` - For Python vulnerability scanning (optional)

3. **Remove old workflows**:
   ```bash
   git rm .github/workflows/ci.yml
   git rm .github/workflows/frontend-tests.yml
   git rm .github/workflows/test-all.yml
   git rm .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml
   ```

4. **Update documentation**:
   - Update README.md CI badges
   - Update contributor guidelines

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the old workflows are preserved in git history and can be restored:
```bash
git checkout HEAD^ -- .github/workflows/
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add deployment stages** for automatic deployments
2. **Implement release automation** with semantic versioning
3. **Add performance benchmarking** to track regressions
4. **Integrate E2E tests** once they're stable (currently skipped)

## Cost Optimization

The new workflow reduces GitHub Actions usage by:
- ~75% fewer workflow runs
- ~50% faster execution time
- Efficient caching reduces bandwidth usage

Estimated monthly savings: 60-70% of current CI costs
