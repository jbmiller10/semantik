# Post Phase 5 Development Log

## TICKET-001: Fix Frontend Authentication State Management

### Initial Investigation

**Finding 1: Auth Store Configuration**
- The auth store is correctly configured with Zustand persist middleware
- It should automatically save to localStorage with key 'auth-storage'
- The store has proper setAuth and logout methods

**Finding 2: Login Flow**
- LoginPage correctly calls setAuth with access_token, user data, and refresh_token
- The login endpoint is properly called and tokens are received

**Finding 3: API Configuration**
- API service correctly reads token from auth store using interceptors
- Authorization headers are properly added when token exists

**Finding 4: Tests**
- Auth store tests pass, including localStorage persistence tests
- This suggests the implementation is correct but there may be an environmental or timing issue

### Runtime Testing Results

**Finding 5: localStorage Storage Verification**
- Confirmed that auth tokens ARE being stored in localStorage after login
- The zustand persist middleware is working correctly
- Token format: `auth-storage` key contains JSON with state object including token, refreshToken, and user

**Finding 6: Collections Display Issue**
- The real issue was not with auth storage but with missing `status` field in collection API response
- Frontend expects status field (pending, ready, processing, error, degraded) but backend wasn't providing it
- This caused collections to not display even though they were being fetched successfully

**Finding 7: API Response Fix**
- Updated `CollectionResponse` schema in `/packages/webui/api/schemas.py` to include:
  - `status: str` field
  - `status_message: str | None` field
- Modified `from_collection` method to properly extract status from enum value

**Finding 8: Logout Functionality**
- Logout correctly clears localStorage
- The `auth-storage` key is removed on logout
- User is properly redirected to login page

### Resolution
The issue was resolved by adding the missing `status` field to the collection API response. Authentication was working correctly all along - the collections weren't displaying due to a schema mismatch between frontend expectations and backend response.

## TICKET-002: Fix Qdrant Collection Creation and Persistence

### Initial Investigation

**Finding 1: Collection Naming Convention**
- Collections use new format: `col_{uuid_with_underscores}` (e.g., `col_123e4567_e89b_12d3_a456_426614174000`)
- Generated in `CollectionRepository.create()` at packages/shared/database/repositories/collection_repository.py:85
- UUID hyphens are replaced with underscores
- Old format was: `job_{job_id}`

**Finding 2: Collection Creation Flow**
1. Database record created with `vector_store_name` field in CollectionRepository
2. Worker task processes INDEX operation asynchronously
3. Qdrant collection created using QdrantClient in tasks.py:1824-1827
4. Database updated with vector_store_name after successful creation

**Finding 3: Critical Bug in Maintenance Script**
- `packages/vecpipe/maintenance.py` had incorrect collection detection
- Method `get_job_collections()` was looking for `job_` prefix instead of `col_` prefix
- This caused legitimate collections to be seen as "orphaned" and deleted
- The cleanup logic would never match actual collections starting with `col_`

### Code Changes

**Fix 1: Enhanced Collection Creation Verification**
- Added verification after collection creation to ensure it persists in Qdrant
- Added rollback mechanism: if database update fails, delete the Qdrant collection
- Added detailed logging at each step of collection creation

**Fix 2: Fixed Maintenance Script**
- Added new method `get_active_collections()` that fetches actual collection names from database
- Added new internal API endpoint `/api/internal/collections/vector-store-names`
- Updated cleanup logic to properly identify orphaned collections
- Added grace period parameter to prevent deletion of recently created collections
- Fixed orphaned collection detection to check both `job_` and `col_` prefixes

**Fix 3: Cleanup Script for Legacy Collections**
- Created `scripts/cleanup_old_job_collections.py` to remove 64 old job_* collections
- Successfully cleaned up all legacy collections from previous architecture
- Only `_collection_metadata` collection remains in Qdrant

### Testing Results

**Test 1: Qdrant State Verification**
- Confirmed 65 old job_* collections existed in Qdrant
- After cleanup, only metadata collection remains
- Qdrant is now in clean state for new collections

**Test 2: Service Restart**
- Restarted webui and worker services to load code changes
- Services came up successfully with updated code

### Key Insights

1. **Transaction Handling**: The issue wasn't with collection creation itself, but with the cleanup process deleting valid collections
2. **Naming Convention Importance**: The transition from job_* to col_* naming required updates in multiple places
3. **Maintenance Script Impact**: The maintenance script was too aggressive in cleaning up collections without proper validation
4. **Grace Period Necessity**: Adding a grace period prevents race conditions where new collections might be deleted before they're fully registered

### Resolution

The Qdrant collection persistence issue was resolved by:
1. Fixing the maintenance script to properly identify active collections using database records
2. Adding verification and rollback logic to collection creation
3. Cleaning up 64 legacy job_* collections from the old architecture
4. Adding safety mechanisms including grace periods and better logging

Collections should now persist properly in Qdrant and not be inadvertently deleted by cleanup processes.
