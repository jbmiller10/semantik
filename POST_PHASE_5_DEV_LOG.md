# Post Phase 5 Development Log

## TICKET-001: Fix Frontend Authentication State Management

### Initial Investigation

**Finding 1: Auth Store Configuration**
- The auth store is correctly configured with Zustand persist middleware
- It should automatically save to localStorage with key 'auth-storage'
- The store has proper setAuth and logout methods

**Finding 2: Login Flow**
- LoginPage correctly calls setAuth with access_token, user data, and refresh_token
- The login endpoint is properly called and tokens are received

**Finding 3: API Configuration**
- API service correctly reads token from auth store using interceptors
- Authorization headers are properly added when token exists

**Finding 4: Tests**
- Auth store tests pass, including localStorage persistence tests
- This suggests the implementation is correct but there may be an environmental or timing issue

### Runtime Testing Results

**Finding 5: localStorage Storage Verification**
- Confirmed that auth tokens ARE being stored in localStorage after login
- The zustand persist middleware is working correctly
- Token format: `auth-storage` key contains JSON with state object including token, refreshToken, and user

**Finding 6: Collections Display Issue**
- The real issue was not with auth storage but with missing `status` field in collection API response
- Frontend expects status field (pending, ready, processing, error, degraded) but backend wasn't providing it
- This caused collections to not display even though they were being fetched successfully

**Finding 7: API Response Fix**
- Updated `CollectionResponse` schema in `/packages/webui/api/schemas.py` to include:
  - `status: str` field
  - `status_message: str | None` field
- Modified `from_collection` method to properly extract status from enum value

**Finding 8: Logout Functionality**
- Logout correctly clears localStorage
- The `auth-storage` key is removed on logout
- User is properly redirected to login page

### Resolution
The issue was resolved by adding the missing `status` field to the collection API response. Authentication was working correctly all along - the collections weren't displaying due to a schema mismatch between frontend expectations and backend response.
