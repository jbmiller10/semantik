## TASK-018: Create Collection Store & LocalStorage Migration

### 2025-07-17: Initial Implementation

#### Overview
Implemented the collection store and localStorage migration as part of the transition from job-centric to collection-centric architecture. This task establishes the frontend state management foundation for the new UI.

#### Completed Components

1. **TypeScript Types (`apps/webui-react/src/types/collection.ts`)**
   - Created comprehensive types for Collection and Operation entities
   - Added request/response types for API interactions
   - Included WebSocket message types for real-time updates
   - Added frontend-specific fields for optimistic UI updates

2. **Collection Store (`apps/webui-react/src/stores/collectionStore.ts`)**
   - Implemented Zustand store with devtools support
   - Features:
     - Full CRUD operations for collections
     - Operation management (add source, remove source, reindex)
     - Optimistic updates for responsive UI
     - WebSocket update handlers for real-time progress
     - Comprehensive selectors for data access
   - Store structure:
     - Uses Maps for efficient lookups
     - Tracks active operations separately
     - Maintains selected collection state
     - Global loading and error states

3. **V2 API Client (`apps/webui-react/src/services/api/v2/`)**
   - Created type-safe API client for v2 endpoints
   - Three main modules:
     - `collections.ts` - Collection and operation endpoints
     - `operations.ts` - Direct operation management
     - `search.ts` - Multi-collection search support
   - Includes error handling utility
   - Axios-based with existing auth interceptors

4. **LocalStorage Migration (`apps/webui-react/src/utils/localStorageMigration.ts`)**
   - Versioning system for localStorage (current: 2.0.0)
   - Automatic migration on app startup
   - Clears old data patterns:
     - `semantik_*`
     - `auth-storage`
     - `jobs*`
     - `search*`
     - `collections*`
     - `ui-*`
   - Forces reload after migration to ensure clean state

5. **Integration (`apps/webui-react/src/main.tsx`)**
   - Added migration check before React app renders
   - Ensures users with old data get clean slate

6. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive test suite for collection store
   - Tests for localStorage migration utility
   - Coverage includes:
     - CRUD operations
     - Optimistic updates
     - Error handling
     - WebSocket updates
     - Migration scenarios

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **Optimistic Updates**: All mutations update UI immediately while API calls process in background
2. **Map-based Storage**: Using Maps instead of arrays for O(1) lookups
3. **Temporary IDs**: Operations use temp IDs during creation, replaced with real IDs from API
4. **Active Operation Tracking**: Separate Set for quick active operation queries
5. **Forced Reload on Migration**: Ensures no stale state from previous version

#### Technical Notes

- The store is ready for WebSocket integration but WebSocket implementation is not part of this task
- API responses assume axios response structure (`response.data`)
- Default embedding model set to `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` (matching backend)
- Store uses Zustand devtools for debugging in development

#### Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for:
- UI components to consume collection state
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Search functionality across collections
- Operation progress tracking

The localStorage migration ensures smooth transition for existing users when the new UI is deployed.

#### Final Status

âœ… **All tasks completed successfully:**
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- All tests pass (210 tests passing, 1 skipped)
- ESLint reports no errors in new code
- Backend Python checks (ruff, mypy) pass
- Integration ready for UI components to consume

The implementation is complete and ready for integration with the new collection-centric UI components.
