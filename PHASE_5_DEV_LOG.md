## TASK-018: Create Collection Store & LocalStorage Migration

### 2025-07-17: Initial Implementation

#### Overview
Implemented the collection store and localStorage migration as part of the transition from job-centric to collection-centric architecture. This task establishes the frontend state management foundation for the new UI.

#### Completed Components

1. **TypeScript Types (`apps/webui-react/src/types/collection.ts`)**
   - Created comprehensive types for Collection and Operation entities
   - Added request/response types for API interactions
   - Included WebSocket message types for real-time updates
   - Added frontend-specific fields for optimistic UI updates

2. **Collection Store (`apps/webui-react/src/stores/collectionStore.ts`)**
   - Implemented Zustand store with devtools support
   - Features:
     - Full CRUD operations for collections
     - Operation management (add source, remove source, reindex)
     - Optimistic updates for responsive UI
     - WebSocket update handlers for real-time progress
     - Comprehensive selectors for data access
   - Store structure:
     - Uses Maps for efficient lookups
     - Tracks active operations separately
     - Maintains selected collection state
     - Global loading and error states

3. **V2 API Client (`apps/webui-react/src/services/api/v2/`)**
   - Created type-safe API client for v2 endpoints
   - Three main modules:
     - `collections.ts` - Collection and operation endpoints
     - `operations.ts` - Direct operation management
     - `search.ts` - Multi-collection search support
   - Includes error handling utility
   - Axios-based with existing auth interceptors

4. **LocalStorage Migration (`apps/webui-react/src/utils/localStorageMigration.ts`)**
   - Versioning system for localStorage (current: 2.0.0)
   - Automatic migration on app startup
   - Clears old data patterns:
     - `semantik_*`
     - `auth-storage`
     - `jobs*`
     - `search*`
     - `collections*`
     - `ui-*`
   - Forces reload after migration to ensure clean state

5. **Integration (`apps/webui-react/src/main.tsx`)**
   - Added migration check before React app renders
   - Ensures users with old data get clean slate

6. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive test suite for collection store
   - Tests for localStorage migration utility
   - Coverage includes:
     - CRUD operations
     - Optimistic updates
     - Error handling
     - WebSocket updates
     - Migration scenarios

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **Optimistic Updates**: All mutations update UI immediately while API calls process in background
2. **Map-based Storage**: Using Maps instead of arrays for O(1) lookups
3. **Temporary IDs**: Operations use temp IDs during creation, replaced with real IDs from API
4. **Active Operation Tracking**: Separate Set for quick active operation queries
5. **Forced Reload on Migration**: Ensures no stale state from previous version

#### Technical Notes

- The store is ready for WebSocket integration but WebSocket implementation is not part of this task
- API responses assume axios response structure (`response.data`)
- Default embedding model set to `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` (matching backend)
- Store uses Zustand devtools for debugging in development

#### Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for:
- UI components to consume collection state
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Search functionality across collections
- Operation progress tracking

The localStorage migration ensures smooth transition for existing users when the new UI is deployed.

#### Final Status

✅ **All tasks completed successfully:**
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- All tests pass (210 tests passing, 1 skipped)
- ESLint reports no errors in new code
- Backend Python checks (ruff, mypy) pass
- Integration ready for UI components to consume

The implementation is complete and ready for integration with the new collection-centric UI components.

## TASK-019: Implement Collection Dashboard

### 2025-07-17: Collection Dashboard Implementation

#### Overview
Implemented the collection dashboard as the new primary landing page for Semantik, replacing the job-centric view with a collection-centric interface. This provides users with a clear overview of their collections and easy access to collection management features.

#### Completed Components

1. **Collections Dashboard (`apps/webui-react/src/components/CollectionsDashboard.tsx`)**
   - Features:
     - Grid layout with responsive columns (1-3 based on screen size)
     - Real-time search functionality
     - Status-based filtering (All, Ready, Processing, Error, Degraded)
     - Result count display when filtering
     - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds for active operations
     - Empty state for new users with prominent "Create Collection" CTA
     - Loading and error states
   - Uses the collection store from TASK-018
   - Sorts collections by updated_at (most recent first)

2. **Enhanced Collection Card (`apps/webui-react/src/components/CollectionCard.tsx`)**
   - Updated to work with new Collection type from v2 API
   - Visual improvements:
     - Status badges with icons and colors
     - Processing animation with progress bar
     - Border color changes based on status
     - Active operation messages
     - Error/degraded status messages
   - Shows collection details:
     - Name with truncation
     - Description (if available)
     - Embedding model
     - Document and vector counts
     - Last updated date
   - Disabled state during processing operations

3. **Create Collection Modal (`apps/webui-react/src/components/CreateCollectionModal.tsx`)**
   - Comprehensive form for creating new collections:
     - Collection name (required)
     - Description (optional)
     - Embedding model selection with sensible defaults
     - Advanced settings: chunk size and overlap
     - Public/private toggle
   - Form validation:
     - Required field validation
     - Character limits
     - Numeric range validation
   - Keyboard support (Escape to close)
   - Loading state during submission
   - Error handling with toast notifications

4. **Navigation Updates**
   - Reordered tabs to put Collections first
   - Changed default active tab to 'collections' in uiStore
   - Collections is now the primary landing experience

5. **Type System Updates**
   - Fixed TypeScript imports to use type-only imports
   - Updated CollectionCard tests to use new Collection type
   - Removed old CollectionList component (replaced by CollectionsDashboard)
   - Fixed type errors in CreateCollectionModal

#### Key Design Decisions

1. **Grid Layout**: Chose responsive grid over list view for better visual hierarchy
2. **Status-First**: Made collection status prominent with colored badges and icons
3. **Search & Filter**: Combined text search with status filtering for flexible browsing
4. **Empty State**: Clear guidance for new users with prominent collection creation
5. **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh for collections with active operations

#### Testing Updates

- Updated HomePage tests to reference CollectionsDashboard
- Rewrote CollectionCard tests for new Collection type structure
- All frontend tests passing (202 tests)
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Python linting and type checking pass

#### UI/UX Improvements

- Collections dashboard is now the default landing page
- Clear visual feedback for collection states
- Intuitive search and filtering
- Responsive design works well on different screen sizes
- Processing states are clearly indicated
- Empty state provides clear next steps

#### Integration Notes

- The dashboard successfully integrates with the collection store
- API calls use the new v2 endpoints
- WebSocket handlers are in place for future real-time updates
- Modal system provides smooth interaction flow

#### Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for:
- Collection details view integration
- Batch operations on collections
- Collection sharing features
- Advanced filtering options
- Collection templates

The Collections Dashboard successfully transforms Semantik's UI from job-centric to collection-centric, providing users with a clear and intuitive interface for managing their document collections.

#### Final Status

✅ **All acceptance criteria met:**
- Grid of CollectionCard components implemented
- Search and filter controls functional
- Create Collection button launches modal
- Empty state for new users implemented
- Dashboard is the new primary landing page
- All tests passing
- No linting or type errors

The implementation is complete and ready for the next phase of development.
